Efforts to understand terrain effects on tornadoes have been limited in scope, typically examining a small number of cases with limited observations or idealized numerical simulations. This study evaluates an apparent tornado activity maximum across the Sand Mountain and Lookout Mountain plateaus of northeastern Alabama. These plateaus, separated by the narrow Wills Valley, span ~5000 km2 and were impacted by 79 tornadoes from 1992 to 2016. This area represents a relative regional statistical maximum in tornadogenesis, with a particular tendency for tornadogenesis on the northwestern side of Sand Mountain. This exploratory paper investigates storm behavior and possible physical explanations for this density of tornadogenesis events and tornadoes. Long-term surface observation datasets indicate that surface winds tend to be stronger and more backed atop Sand Mountain than over the adjacent Tennessee Valley, potentially indicative of changes in the low-level wind profile supportive to storm rotation. The surface data additionally indicate potentially lower lifting condensation levels over the plateaus versus the adjacent valleys, an attribute previously shown to be favorable for tornadogenesis. Rapid Update Cycle and Rapid Refresh model output indicate that Froude numbers for the plateaus in tornadic environments are likely supportive of enhanced low-level flow over the plateaus, which further indicates the potential for favorable wind profile changes for tornado production. Examples of tornadic storms rapidly acquiring increased low-level rotation while reaching the plateaus of northeast Alabama are presented. The use of this background to inform the VORTEX-SE 2017 field campaign is discussed.","Lyza et al.

A Perspective Based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite Observations and Noah Land Surface Model With Multiparameterization Schemes Model Simulations","Drylands cover over 40% of the global land area and are home to more than 2 billion humans. Here, we use the terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly data derived from GRACE satellites to assess water storage changes globally and find that drylands lost ~15.9  9.1 mm of water between April 2002 and January 2017. The TWS trends are more significant and apparent in dry regions than in humid regions. The decrease in TWS occurred mainly in hyperarid and arid regions. Exact causes to the observed declines in TWS remain elusive due to anthropogenic water withdrawals, atmospheric demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET) in contrast to supply (precipitation, P) caused by the warming, and terrestrial ecohydrological responses. Therefore, we use a processbased model forced by climate data to interpret the causes over three selected dryland regions showing the strongest drying trends. We find that the modeled TWS without considering anthropogenic water withdrawals explains most of the declining GRACE TWS over the southwestern North America (NA) and Middle East but underestimates the drying trend over North China. This suggests that TWS declines in the southwestern NA and the Middle East were primarily driven by the contrast between atmospheric demand and supply, whereas anthropogenic water withdrawals may have played a relatively more dominant role in TWS declines over North China.

Here, we aim to understand the impacts of elevated CO2 on future runoff changes through ecosystem responses to both rising CO2 and associated warming using the NoahMP model with representations of vegetation dynamics and plant hydraulics. We first validated NoahMP against observed runoff, leaf area index (LAI), and terrestrial water storage anomaly from 1980 to 2015. We then projected future runoff with NoahMP under downscaled climates from three climate models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The projected runoff declines variably from the Pacific Northwest by 11% to the Lower Colorado River basin by 92% from 2016 to 2099. To discern the exact causes, we conducted an attribution analysis of the modeled evapotranspiration from two additional sensitivity experiments: one with constant CO2 and another one with static monthly LAI climatology. Results show that surface ""greening"" (due to the CO2 fertilization effect) and the stomatal closure effect are the second largest contributors to future runoff change, following the warming effect.

We obtained the annual dynamics of T/ET in a semi-arid area of the southwestern United States based on the medians of monthly T/ET derived from two ET partitioning methods. The variation in monthly T/ET was analysed, and plant water use strategies were discussed based on the water use efficiency evaluated by the transpiration (WUE_T). The results show that physiological changes in plants are vital in the annual dynamics of T/ET. Switches in plant physiological status (growth and dormancy) at the start and end of growing seasons induce two dramatic changes in T/ET. Consequently, there is an annual bimodal dynamic of monthly T/ET, with a maximum of 0.84 in October and a minimum of 0.14 in December. Physiological/biochemical variations of plants indicated by solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are linearly related to T/ET in growing seasons at a monthly scale (T/ET = 3.40  SIF + 0.36, R2 = 0.987). Generally, a stable high monthly T/ET occurs under sufficient energy and water conditions and a highly variable monthly T/ET occurs under energy and water deficient conditions. In semi-arid regions, plants can flexibly adjust WUE_T following different water use strategies to survive or gain as much gross primary productivity (GPP) to compete. Saving water by greatly elevating WUE_T is the main strategy by which plants survive the non-growing season when WUE_T is linearly related to SIF (WUE_T = -114.93  SIF + 3.25, R2 = 0.970). However, GPP and not WUE_T, becomes the goal of plants in growing seasons when they employ a stable and moderate WUE_T (around 2.1 gC kg1 H2O) despite the abundant energy and precipitation. There are obvious reductions in WUE_T during the transition periods of the plants' 'growth-dormancy' cycle.

Stateoftheart models, however, show significant simulation biases. In this study, we assess the main uncertainty associated with model physics in snow cover modeling over the TP using groundbased observations and highresolution snow cover satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun3B (FY3B). We first conducted 10km simulations using the Noah with multiparameterization (NoahMP) land surface model by optimizing physicsscheme options, which reduces 8.2% absolute bias of annual snow cover fraction (SCF) compared with the default model settings. Then, five SCF parameterizations in NoahMP were optimized and assessed, with three of them further reducing the annual SCF biases from around 15% to less than 2%. Thus, optimizing SCF parameterizations appears to be more important than optimizing physicsscheme options in reducing the uncertainty of snow modeling.

The experiments are for the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) and Susquehanna River Basin (SRB), which feature seasonal and ephemeral snow covers, respectively. Results indicate that 3DVAR with a 5d assimilation frequency generally outperforms the other scenarios. The assimilation of the blended SWE product mitigates the underestimation of SWE evident in the open-loop simulations for both basins and its impacts are more pronounced for UCRB than for SRB since snowfall is the main source of precipitation in the former. Assimilation leads to improved streamflow over a majority of SRB subbasins, but over a minority of UCRB subbasins. The degradations in streamflow for UCRB subbasins are mainly caused by the overestimated SWE.

Climate warming will enhance the frequency, magnitude, and widespread nature of these events. Past studies indicate rainfall, not snowmelt, typically drives much of the runoff response during ROS. However, there is substantial event-to-event variability-resulting from shifting atmospheric drivers and nuanced physical mechanisms governing water flow through a snowpack. Historically, turbulent fluxes were assumed to dominate the energy balance for snowmelt during ROS. Recent research nonetheless suggests that other components of the energy balance might be larger drivers depending on: 1) the time of year; 2) the elevation; and 3) the aspect of the slope. This mini review summarizes the literature on the physical processes governing ROS and proposes that moving forward we utilize the terms ""active"" and ""passive"" to describe a snowpack's contribution (via snowmelt) to terrestrial water input (TWI) during ROS. Active snowpacks readily contribute meltwater to TWI via the energy balance, bolstering rainfall-runoff totals. Passive snowpacks do not melt, but simply convey rainwater through the snow matrix.

Seven of the products are introduced for the first time in this study: one multi-sensor merged satellite product called MeMo (Merged soil Moisture) and six estimates from the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrns Vattenbalansavdelning) model with three precipitation inputs (ERA5, IMERG, and MSWEP) with and without assimilation of SMAPL3E satellite retrievals, respectively. As reference, we used in situ soil moisture measurements between 2015 and 2019 at 5 cm depth from 826 sensors, located primarily in the USA and Europe. The 3-hourly Pearson correlation (R) was chosen as the primary performance metric. We found that application of the Soil Wetness Index (SWI) smoothing filter resulted in improved performance for all satellite products. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the four single-sensor satellite products was SMAPL3ESWI, SMOSSWI, AMSR2SWI, and ASCATSWI, with the L-band-based SMAPL3ESWI (median R of 0.72) outperforming the others at 50 % of the sites.

Thus, some small-scale factors must support tornadogenesis in some supercells and not in others. In this study we examined polarimetric radar signatures of proximate pretornadic and nontornadic supercells in seemingly similar environments to determine if these radar signatures can indicate which proximate supercells are pretornadic and which are nontornadic. We gathered a collection of proximity supercell groups and developed a method to quantify environmental similarity between storms. Using this method, we selected pretornadic-nontornadic supercell pairs in close proximity in space and time having the most similar environments. These pairs were run through an automated tracking algorithm that quantifies polarimetric signatures in each supercell. Supercells with larger differential reflectivity (ZDR) column areas were more likely to become tornadic within the next 30 min compared to neighboring supercells with smaller ZDR column areas. In about two-thirds of pairs, the pretornadic supercell had a larger ZDR column area than the nontornadic supercell prior to its maximum low-level rotation, which is consistent with much prior work. The ZDR arcs could not discriminate between pretornadic and nontornadic supercells, and hailfall area was larger in pretornadic supercells. The separation distance between the specific differential phase (KDP) foot and the ZDR arc was larger in pretornadic supercells, yet was a limited result due to the small sample size used for comparison.

However, sometimes multiple thunderstorms exist in a similar environment, and some produce tornadoes while others do not. Weather radar can identify signatures within thunderstorms that may give some indication of vertical motion, size sorting, and precipitation distributions.

Assuming a supercell exists, the role of low-level storm-relative flowin regulating supercells' low-level mesocyclone intensity is less clear. One possibility considered in this article is that storm-relative flow controls mesocyclone and tornado width via its modulation of overall updraft extent. This hypothesis relies on a previously postulated positive correspondence between updraft width, mesocyclone width, and tornado width. An alternative hypothesis is that mesocyclone characteristics are primarily regulated by horizontal streamwise vorticity irrespective of storm-relative flow. A matrix of supercell simulations were analyzed to address the aforementioned hypotheses, wherein horizontal streamwise vorticity and storm-relative flow were independently varied. Among these simulations, mesocyclone width and intensity were strongly correlated with horizontal streamwise vorticity, and comparatively weakly correlated with storm-relative flow, supporting the second hypothesis. Accompanying theory and trajectory analysis offers the physical explanation that, when storm-relative flow is large and updrafts are wide, vertically tilted streamwise vorticity is projected over a wider area but with a lesser average magnitude than when these parameters are small.

In particular, the occurrence and structure of upscale energy transfer (backscatter) in the hurricane boundary layer as well as the effects of backscatter on the vortex intensity are unknown. The analysis presented here of very high-resolution, three-dimensional wind observations from Hurricane Rita (2005) at peak intensity reveals large regions of organized backscatter in the boundary layer associated with coherent, turbulent eddies. Strong forwardscatter is also found next to the backscatter regions due to the interaction between adjacent eddies. Two components of the stress tensor are primarily responsible for this alternating scatter structure, as shown by large correlation coefficients between the fields: the radial-vertical component ( 13) and the azimuthal-vertical component ( 23) with average correlations of 79 % and 49 %, respectively. The Leonard, Reynolds and cross-term stress components are also provided. The impact of the sub-filter-scale energy transfer is estimated by computing the kinetic energy budget for the resolved-scale and eddy-scale motions.

MPD is designed to provide continuous vertical water vapor profiles with high vertical (150 m) and temporal resolution (5 min) in the lower troposphere. This study aims to investigate MPD observation impacts and the scientific significance of MPDs for convective weather analyses and predictions using observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs). In this study, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) Model are used to conduct OSSEs for a case study of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) observed during the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) experiment.

The study was conducted using a convective event that occurred in New York on 21 June 2021. A line of severe thunderstorms developed, decayed, and then re-intensified as it propagated eastward across the state. Several data assimilation (DA) experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of NYSM data using the operational DA system Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) with rapid update cycles. The assimilated datasets included National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Automated Data Processing (ADP) global upper-air and surface observations, NYSM surface observations, Doppler lidar wind retrievals and microwave radiometer (MWR) thermodynamic retrievals at NYSM profiler sites. In comparison with the control experiment that assimilated only conventional data, the timing and location of the convection reintensification was significantly improved by assimilating NYSM data, especially the Doppler lidar wind data. Our analysis indicated that the improvement could be attributed to improved simulation of the Mohawk-Hudson Convergence.

The recent development of a low-cost diode-laser-based (DLB) micro-pulse differential absorption lidar (DIAL) has begun to address the need for ground-based remote sensing instruments for water vapor profiling in the lower troposphere. Now, taking advantage of the broad spectral coverage of the DLB architecture, an enhancement to the water vapor micro-pulse DIAL (MPD) instrument is proposed to enable atmospheric temperature profiling. The new instrument is based on measuring a temperature-dependent oxygen (O2) absorption coefficient and using this to retrieve the range-resolved temperature profile. In this paper, a retrieval method is proposed based on the recently developed perturbative solution to the DIAL equation that takes into account the Doppler broadening of the molecularly backscattered signal. This perturbative solution relies on an ancillary high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) measurement of the backscatter ratio. Data from an operational water vapor MPD combined with a DLB-HSRL were used to create an atmosphere model, from which return signals for the O2-MPD were generated. The perturbative retrieval was then applied to these data and a comparison of the retrieved temperature and the model temperature profile allowed the efficacy of retrieval to be evaluated.

We have been developing an active remote sensing technology based on a diode-laser-based lidar technology to address this observational need. Narrowband, high-spectral-fidelity diode lasers enable accurate and calibration-free measurements requiring a minimal set of assumptions based on direct absorption (Beer-Lambert law) and a ratio of two signals. These well-proven quantitative methods are known as differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL). This diode-laser-based architecture, characterized by less powerful laser transmitters than those historically used for atmospheric studies, can be made eye-safe and robust. Nevertheless, it also requires solar background suppression techniques such as narrow-field-of-view receivers with an ultra-narrow bandpass to observe individual photons backscattered from the atmosphere. We discuss this diode-laser-based lidar architecture's latest generation and analyze how it addresses a national-scale profiling network's need to provide continuous thermodynamic observations.

The objective of this study is to quantify the annual and monthly variability of low flow river conditions over the Southeastern United States (US) using National Water Model (NWM) retrospective simulations (v2.1), which provide streamflow estimates at a high spatial density. The data were used to calculate sums of outflow deficit volumes at annual and monthly scales, from which the autocorrelation functions (ACF), partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) and the Hurst exponent (H) were calculated to quantify low flow patterns. The ACF/PACF approach is used for examining the seasonal and multiannual variation of extreme events, while the Hurst exponent in turn allows for classification of ""process memory"", distinguishing multi-seasonal processes from white noise processes. The results showed diverse spatial and temporal patterns of low flow occurrence across the Southeast US study area, with some locations indicating a strong seasonal dependence. These locations are characterized by a longer temporal cycle, whereby low flows were arranged in series of several to dozens of years, after which they did not occur for a period of similar length. In these rivers, H was in the range 0.8 (+/0.15), which implies a stronger relation with groundwater during dry periods. In other river segments within the study region the probability of low flows appeared random, determined by H oscillating around the values for white noise (0.5 +/0.15). The initial assessment of spatial clusters of the low flow parameters suggests no strict relationships, although a link to geologic characteristics and aquifer depth was noticed. At monthly scales, low flow occurrence followed precipitation patterns, with streamflow droughts first occurring in the Carolinas and along the Gulf Coast around May and then progressing upstream, reaching maxima around October for central parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. The relations for both annual and monthly scales are better represented with PACF, for which statistically significant lags were found in around 75% of stream nodes, while ACF explains on average only 20% of cases, indicating that streamflow droughts in the region occur in regular patterns (e.g., seasonal). This repeatability is of greater importance to defining patterns of extreme hydrologic events than the occurrence of high magnitude random events.

However, the spatial distribution of snow is not well understood, and therefore, it is not well modeled, which can lead to substantial uncertainties in snow cover representations. To capture key hydro-ecological controls on snow spatial distribution, we carried out intensive field studies over multiple years for two small (2017-2019; 2.5km2) sub-Arctic study sites located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Using an intensive suite of field observations (>22000 data points), we developed simple models of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) using factors such as topographic characteristics, vegetation characteristics based on greenness (normalized different vegetation index, NDVI), and a simple metric for approximating winds. The most successful model was random forest, using both study sites and all years, which was able to accurately capture the complexity and variability of snow characteristics across the sites. Approximately 86% of the SWE distribution could be accounted for, on average, by the random forest model at the study sites. Factors that impacted year-to-year snow distribution included NDVI, elevation, and a metric to represent coarse microtopography (topographic position index, TPI), while slope, wind, and fine microtopography factors were less important.

Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snow-covered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of F-scores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snow-related processes.","Thaler el al.

Applying multiresolution kriging, gridded analyses of bias-corrected smartphone pressure observations were made for an entire year (2018), using both anonymized (ANON) and nonanonymized (UID) observations.

Each simulated TC is subject to storm motion, wind shear, and oceanic coupling. Different storm intensities are achieved through different ocean profiles in the model initialization. For each oceanic profile, the atmospheric simulations are performed with and without TKE advection. In all simulations, the TKE is maximized at low levels (i.e., below 1 km) and 0.5 km radially inward of the azimuthalmean radius of maximum wind speed at 1km height. As in a previous study, the axisymmetric TKE decreases with height in the eyewall, but more abruptly in simulations without TKE advection. The largest TKE budget terms are shear generation and dissipation, though variability in vertical turbulent transport and buoyancy production affect the change in the azimuthalmean TKE distribution. The general relationships between the TKE budget terms are consistent across different radii, regardless of storm intensity. In terms of the asymmetric distribution in the eyewall, TKE is maximized in the frontleft quadrant where the sea surface temperature (SST) is highest and is minimized in the rearright quadrant where the SST is the lowest.

As with the TCBD, an asymmetric distribution of 10-m e for TCs experiencing southerly component shear and a symmetric distribution of 10-m e for TCs experiencing northerly component shear was found using composite observations from dropsondes. These analyses show that differences in the degree of symmetry near the sea surface extend through the depth of the boundary layer. Additionally, mean dropsonde profiles illustrate that TCs experiencing northerly component shear are more potentially unstable between 500- and 1000-m altitude, signaling a more favorable environment for the development of surface-based convection in rainband regions. Analyses from the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) database show that subsequent strengthening for TCs in the Atlantic Ocean basin preferentially occurs in northerly component deep-layer environmental wind shear environments whereas subsequent weakening preferentially occurs in southerly component wind shear environments, which further illustrates that the asymmetric distribution of boundary layer thermodynamics is unfavorable for TC intensification. These differences emphasize the impact of deep-layer wind shear direction on TC intensity changes that likely result from the superposition of large-scale advection with the shear-relative asymmetries in TC structure.","Wadler et al.

During the first and last periods, coinciding with intensification, the ventilation was relatively small due to a lack of spatial correlation between radial flow and e azimuthal asymmetries. During the second period, coinciding with weakening, the ventilation was relatively large. The increased ventilation was caused by greater shear associated with an upper-level trough, tilting the vortex, along with dry, low-e air wrapping in upshear. The spatial correlation of the radial inflow and anomalously low-e air resulted in large ventilation at mid-to-upper levels. Additionally, at low-to-mid levels, there was evidence of mesoscale inflow of low-e air in the stationary band complex. The location of these radial ventilation pathways and their effects on Sam's intensity are consistent with previous idealized and real-case modeling studies.

However, many of those studies averaged across a myriad of different atmospheric conditions and surface forcings that can obfuscate the atmospheric conditions when NWP models perform well versus when they perform inadequately. To help isolate these different weather conditions, we used observations from the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) obtained between 1 January and 31 December 2021 to distinguish among different near-surface atmospheric conditions i.e., different near-surface heating rates (<inline-formula id=IE1/>), incoming shortwave radiation (SWd) regimes, and 5-cm soil moisture (SM05) to evaluate the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Model, which is a 3-km model used for operational weather forecasting in the United States. On days with small (large) <inline-formula id=IE2/>, we found afternoon T biases of about 2C (1C) and afternoon SWd biases of up to 170 W m2 (100 W m2), but negligible impacts on SM05 biases. On days with small (large) SWd, we found daytime temperature biases of about 3C (2.5C) and daytime SWd biases of up to 190 W m2 (80 W m2). Whereas different SM05 had little impact on T and SWd biases, dry (wet) conditions had positive (negative) SM05 biases.

Empirical evidence of aerosol mixing processes within the ABL during synoptic-scale events over arid and semiarid regions (i.e., drylands) remains sparse. We explored how synoptic-scale weather systems impact aerosol mixing processes within the daytime ABL over a site located in a dryland. We used ground-based Doppler lidar measurements collected during three events: a cold-front passage, a fair-weather day, and a dryline passage over Lubbock, Texas. The measurements of backscatter and vertical velocity fields were obtained with temporal and vertical resolutions of 1 s and 60 m, respectively. Here, we documented observations of aerosol transport and mixing within the ABL and found that frontal passages are crucial for understanding ABL features and aerosol mixing processes. For example, our findings suggest that during a dryline passage yielding a water vapor mixing ratio drop of 10 g kg1, the boundary layer characteristics transition from being shallow and stratified throughout a stable, pre-dryline ABL aerosol regime (300 m deep) to a deep and well-mixed structure within the post-dryline ABL (2200 m deep) confirming a higher ABL depth growth rate (300 mh1) than under quiescent conditions (125 m h1). The results for the frontal case reported aerosol mixing via frontal lifting to an altitude of 1250 m from the ground due to strong updrafts (>7 m s1). Additionally, Doppler lidar measurements helped to characterize the aerosol mixing and transport processes in dry regions under different weather conditions which yielded close correspondence with the observed variability in near-surface particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) concentrations (e.g., increase in PM2.5 from 9 g m3 to 27 g m3 due to a cold front passage). The aerosol transport, along with the derived properties of the mean up- and downdraft observations and variance-based (both vertical velocity and aerosol backscatter) turbulence profiling helped explain how frontal airmass exchanges impact aerosol loading near the surface.

Each simulated TC is subject to storm motion, wind shear, and oceanic coupling. Different storm intensities are achieved through different ocean profiles in the model initialization. For each oceanic profile, the atmospheric simulations are performed with and without TKE advection. In all simulations, the TKE is maximized at low levels (i.e., below 1 km) and 0.5 km radially inward of the azimuthalmean radius of maximum wind speed at 1km height. As in a previous study, the axisymmetric TKE decreases with height in the eyewall, but more abruptly in simulations without TKE advection. The largest TKE budget terms are shear generation and dissipation, though variability in vertical turbulent transport and buoyancy production affect the change in the azimuthalmean TKE distribution. The general relationships between the TKE budget terms are consistent across different radii, regardless of storm intensity. In terms of the asymmetric distribution in the eyewall, TKE is maximized in the frontleft quadrant where the sea surface temperature (SST) is highest and is minimized in the rearright quadrant where the SST is the lowest. In the category5 simulation, the height of the TKE maximum varies significantly in the eyewall between quadrants and is between 400 m in the rearright quadrant and 1,000 m in the frontleft quadrant.

This work attempts to enhance icing detection and characterization utilizing data from the New York State Mesonet (NYSM). NYSM is the first operational network measuring winds at 10 m from two independent sensors: propeller and sonic anemometers. During and after freezing rain events, large wind speed differences are frequently reported between the two anemometers because the propeller develops a coating of ice, thus either stopping or slowing its rotation. Such errors of propeller data provide a signal for identifying icing conditions. An automated method for identifying ""active freezing rain"" (AFR) and a continuation of ""frozen surface"" (FS) conditions is developed. Hourly maps of AFR and FS sites are generated using four criteria: 1) a wind speed difference (sonic  propeller) of >1 m s1 or 0 m s1 propeller wind speed for at least a half hour, 2) a temperature threshold of 5 to 2C for AFR and less than 2C for FS, 3) insignificant hourly snow accumulation, and 4) with (without) significant hourly precipitation accumulation for AFR (FS). The AFR events detected by the automated method for last four winters (2017-21) show very good agreements in starting and ending times with that from the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) data.

However, there exists a disconnect in heat-related communication from experts, who commonly include heat-related jargon (i.e., technical language), to decision-makers and the general public. The use of jargon has been shown to reduce meaningful engagement with and understanding of messages written by experts. Translating technical language into comprehensible messages that encourage decision-makers to take action has been identified as a priority to enable impact-based decision support. Knowing what concepts and terms are perceived as jargon, and why, is a first step to increasing communication effectiveness. With this in mind, we focus on the mental models about extreme heat among two groups of domain experts-those trained in atmospheric science and those trained in emergency management-to identify how each group understands terms and concepts about extreme heat. We use a hybrid data collection method of open card sorting and think-aloud interviews to identify how participants conceptualize and categorize terms and concepts related to extreme heat. While we find few differences within the sorted categories, we learn that the processes leading to decisions about the importance of including, or not including, technical information differ by group. The results lead to recommendations and priorities for communicating about extreme heat. Significance Statement Effective communication between domain experts is a priority for informed decision-making under extreme weather conditions. As severe heat events increase in frequency and severity, the ability to communicate about heat and its impacts in a clear manner will become vital to life safety.

However, traditional inspection methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, prone to human error, and may not provide the comprehensive coverage required for the detailed analysis of crop variability across an entire field. This research addresses the need for efficient and high-resolution crop monitoring by leveraging Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery and advanced computational techniques. The primary goal was to develop a methodology for the precise identification, extraction, and monitoring of individual corn crops throughout their growth cycle. This involved integrating UAV-derived data with image processing, computational geometry, and machine learning techniques. Bi-weekly UAV imagery was captured at altitudes of 40 m and 70 m from 30 April to 11 August, covering the entire growth cycle of the corn crop from planting to harvest. A time-series Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated by analyzing the differences between the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from the UAV data. To ensure the accuracy of the elevation data, the DSM was validated against Ground Control Points (GCPs), adhering to standard practices in remote sensing data verification. Local spatial analysis and image processing techniques were employed to determine the local maximum height of each crop. Subsequently, a Voronoi data model was developed to delineate individual crop canopies, successfully identifying 13,000 out of 13,050 corn crops in the study area. To enhance accuracy in canopy size delineation, vegetation indices were incorporated into the Voronoi model segmentation, refining the initial canopy area estimates by eliminating interference from soil and shadows. The proposed methodology enables the precise estimation and monitoring of crop canopy size, height, biomass reduction, lodging, and stunted growth over time by incorporating advanced image processing techniques and integrating metrics for quantitative assessment of fields.

The assimilation of UAS observations in addition to surface observations results in a clear increase in skill for both flow regimes over that obtained when assimilating surface observations alone. For the terrain-driven flow case, the UAS observations improved the representation of thermal stratification across the northern SLV which produced stronger upvalley flow over the eastern half of the SLV that better matched the observations. For the CI case, the UAS observations improved the representation of the pre-convective environment by reducing dry biases across the SLV and over the surrounding terrain. This led to earlier CI and more organized convection over the foothills that spilled outflows into the SLV, ultimately helping to increase low-level convergence and CI there.

Unlike the conventional cokriging methods which are susceptible to conditional bias (CB), the proposed technique, referred to herein as conditional bias-penalized cokriging (CBPCK), explicitly minimizes Type-II CB for improved quantitative estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation. CBPCK is a bivariate version of extended conditional bias-penalized kriging (ECBPK) developed for gauge-only analysis. To evaluate CBPCK, cross validation and visual examination are carried out using multi-year hourly radar and gauge data in the North Central Texas region in which CBPCK is compared with the variant of the ordinary cokriging (OCK) algorithm used operationally in the National Weather Service Multisensor Precipitation Estimator. The results show that CBPCK significantly reduces Type-II CB for estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation, and that the margin of improvement over OCK is larger in areas of higher fractional coverage (FC) of precipitation. When FC > 0.9 and hourly gauge precipitation is > 60 mm, the reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) by CBPCK over radar-only (RO) is about 12 mm while the reduction in RMSE by OCK over RO is about 7 mm.

Hail size forecasts diagnosed using the Thompson hail algorithm and storm surrogates predict hail coverage. For this case hail forecasts predict the coverage of hail with a high level of skill but underpredict hail size. The storm surrogate updraft helicity predicts the coverage of severe hail with the most skill for this case. Model data are analyzed to assess the effects of microphysical treatments related to rimed ice. THO uses diagnostic equations to increase the size of graupel within the hail core. MOR-G and MOR-H predict small rimed ice aloft; excessive size sorting and increased fall speeds cause MOR-H to predict more and larger surface hail than MOR-G. The MY2 and NSSL schemes predict large, dense rimed ice particles because both schemes predict separate hail and graupel categories.

Sensitivity experiments are conducted using two tornadic severe storm events: one with a line of individual supercells and the other one with both isolated cells and a severe convective line. The control experiment (CTRL) assimilates conventional surface observations and geostationary satellite cloud water path into WoFS. Additional experiments also assimilate either GLM FED or radar data (RAD), or a combination of both (RAD+GLM). It is found that assimilating GLM data in the absence of radar data into the WoFS improves the short-term forecast skill over CTRL in one case, while in the other case it degrades the forecast skill by generating weaker cold pools and overly suppressing convection, mainly owing to assimilating zero FED values in the trailing stratiform regions. Assimilating unexpectedly low FED values in some regions due to low GLM detection efficiency also accounts for the poorer forecasts.

With the convection parameterization no longer active, much uncertainty in the formulation of subgrid-scale processes moves to other areas such as the cloud microphysical, turbulence, and land surface parameterizations. The goal of this study is to investigate experiments with stochastically perturbed parameters (SPP) within a microphysics parameterization and the model's horizontal diffusion coefficients. To estimate the ""true"" uncertainty due to parameter uncertainty, the magnitudes of the perturbations are chosen as realistically as possible and not with a purposeful intent of maximal forecast impact as some prior work has done. Spatial inhomogeneities and temporal persistence are represented using a random perturbation pattern with spatial and temporal correlations. The impact on the distributions of various hydrometeors, precipitation characteristics, and solar and longwave radiation are quantified for a winter case and a summer case.

In this work, we describe a modular storm drain model that can easily be coupled with existing gridded distributed hydrologic models for real-time flash flood forecasting, and stormwater planning and management for large urban areas (>100km2). A salient feature of our approach is the use of the equivalent storm drain network (ESDN) which approximates the actual network on the same grid as that of the distributed hydrologic model, thereby rendering coupling simple and modular. In the integrated model, storm-drain flow occurs through the simplified network coarsened to the resolution of the distributed hydrologic model without full 1D-2D dynamics or very detailed man-made structures and features modeled. The integrated model is applied to a 144.6km2 area of five urban catchments in the Cities of Arlington and Grand Prairie in Texas, US. Comparisons at selected locations using kinematic-wave flow simulations show that the ESDN approximates the flow through the original network very well with attendant savings in computational amount and reduction in modeling complexities. The impact of the storm drain network is assessed via a combination of simulation experiments, sensitivity analysis and limited comparison with observed flow. It is shown that the storm drain network in highly urbanized catchments in the study area is very effective in reducing surface flow at most locations for about 30min following onset of significant rainfall, that the existing stormwater infrastructure would lose effectiveness for approximately 30% of the study area with a 15% increase in imperviousness relative to the current conditions, and that significant uncertainties exist in partitioning of surface flow into storm drain and natural channel flows due to sensitivity to inlet flow modeling. With greatly reduced computing cost and modeling complexity, the proposed approach offers a practical solution for integrated stormwater modeling for large urban areas for a wide range of applications. The proposed approach cannot, however, resolve flow at sub-grid scales and hence is not appropriate for very detailed modeling for small areas.","Habibi et al.

In this study, we conduct processlevel snowpack analyses of a widely used convectionpermitting (4km) weather research and forecasting (WRF) modeling product (WRF4km) for the contiguous U.S. to understand the mechanisms causing its unobserved earlyspring snow ablation over Utah mountains. Analyses across Utah Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites show that the unobserved snowpack ablation during midFebruary to lateMarch in WRF4km is driven by multiple strong melting events. The melting results from the enhanced downward sensible heat flux to snowpack and enhanced ground solar radiation absorption, with generally larger contributions from the former before early March and from the latter after early March. The enhanced downward sensible heat flux to snowpack is mainly due to the enhanced surface heat exchange coefficient induced by high surface wind speeds. The enhanced ground solar radiation absorption is driven by both enhanced surface downward solar radiation and strong meltinginduced snow cover reduction that is caused by deficiencies in NoahMP snowrelated parameterizations used in WRF4km. The substantial snow cover reduction during melting decreases surface albedo and hence triggers a positive albedo feedback that further accelerates melting.

Here, we use 3m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat 8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes.

In this study, we seek to improve channel representativeness by updating channel geometry and roughness parameters using a large, previously unpublished hydraulic geometry (HyG) dataset of approximately 48000 gauges. We begin with a Sobol' sensitivity analysis of channel geometry parameters for 12 small, semi-natural basins across the continental U.S., which reveals an outsized sensitivity of simulated flow to Manning's n relative to channel geometry parameters. We then develop and evaluate a set of regression-based regionalizations of channel parameters estimated using the HyG dataset.

The earliest initialized forecast of EXPZZDR better predicts the evolution of the El Reno storm than EXPZ, but the two sets of experiments become similar at subsequent forecast times. However, the later EXPZZDR forecasts of the Stillwater storm, which organized toward the end of the DA window, produce improved results compared to EXPZ, in which the storm is less intense and weakens.

The algorithm utilizes ensemble background error covariances filtered to match the observations assimilated. This is realized in a sequential manner. 1) When assimilating coarse-resolution observations such as radiosondes, ensemble background perturbations are filtered to remove scales smaller than those the observations can represent, along with relatively large horizontal localization radii to ensure low-noise and balanced analysis increments. 2) The resulting ensemble analyses from the first step then serve as the background to assimilate denser observations such as radar data with smaller localization radii. Several passes can be taken to assimilate all observations. In this paper, vertically increasing horizontal filter scales are used when assimilating rawinsonde and surface observations together, while radar data are assimilated in the second step. The algorithm is evaluated through six convective storm cases during May 2021, with cycled assimilation of either conventional data only or with additional radar reflectivity followed by 24-h ensemble forecasts. Overall, positive impacts of the MEnKF on forecasts are obtained regardless of reflectivity data; its advantage over the single-scale EnKF is most significant in surface humidity and temperature forecasts up to at least 12 h.

However, current methods to estimate event-specific compound flooding at the household level require high-performance computing resources frequently not available to local stakeholders. Government and non-governmental agencies currently lack the methods to repeatedly and rapidly create flood impact maps that incorporate the local variability in both hazards and social vulnerability.

In this study, we examine the impact of assimilating DWL winds and TDR radial winds on the prediction of Hurricane Earl (2016) with the NCEP operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) system.

Proper choices of data thinning distances (e.g., 5 km horizontal thinning and 70 hPa vertical thinning for DWL) can help achieve better analysis in terms of hurricane vortex representation and forecasts. In the analysis and forecast cycles, the combined TDR and DWL assimilation (DWL wind speed and TDR radial wind, along with other conventional data, e.g., NCEP Automated Data Processing (ADP) data) offsets the downgrade analysis from the absence of DWL observations in an analysis cycle and outperforms assimilation of a single type of data (either TDR or DWL) and leads to improved forecasts of hurricane track, intensity, and structure.

The system considers the temporal evolution of error covariances via the use of four-dimensional ensemble perturbations that are provided by high-resolution, self-consistent HWRF ensemble forecasts. It is different from the configuration of the GSI-based three-dimensional ensemble-variational (GSI-3DEnVar) hybrid data assimilation system, similar to that used in the operational HWRF, which employs background error covariances provided by coarser-resolution global ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) ensemble Kalman filtering data assimilation system. In addition, our proposed initialization framework discards the empirical intensity correction in the vortex initialization package that is employed by the GSI-3DEnVar initialization framework in operational HWRF. Data assimilation and numerical simulation experiments for Hurricanes Joaquin (2015), Patricia (2015), and Matthew (2016) are conducted during their intensity changes. The impacts of two initialization frameworks on the HWRF analyses and forecasts are compared. It is found that GSI-4DEnVar leads to a reduction in track, minimum sea level pressure (MSLP), and maximum surface wind (MSW) forecast errors in all of the HWRF simulations, compared with the GSI-3DEnVar initialization framework.

Constructed using NOAA Weather Prediction Center (WPC) surface analyses, this climatology addresses the limitations of season, time of day, and region of previous dryline studies by using the full surface analysis archive to include drylines throughout the entire day at 3-hour increments for the entire year over the contiguous United States. Severe storm reports and NWS-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings are used to associate individual drylines with severe (or potentially severe) convection. March-June are the months with the greatest frequency of drylines and dryline-associated severe thunderstorms. Regardless of season, average dryline longitude over the course of a day mimics the conceptual model of daily dryline evolution with an eastward shift during the day and westward retreat overnight. The overwhelming majority of WPC-analyzed drylines are located in the Southern Great Plains, particularly southwest Texas through the Texas panhandle, and on average are furthest west in summer and furthest east in winter.

Radar observations of such storms are common and have been leveraged to estimate hail size and severe hail occurrence. However, many established relationships between radar-observed storm characteristics and severe hail occurrence have been found using data for few storms and in isolation from other radar metrics. This study leverages a 10-year record of polarimetric Doppler radar observations in the United States to evaluate and compare radar observations of thousands of severe hail-producing supercells based on their maximum hail size. In agreement with prior studies, it is found that increasing hail size relates to increasing volume of high (50 dBZ) radar reflectivity, increasing mid-altitude mesocyclone rotation (azimuthal shear), increasing storm-top divergence, and decreased differential reflectivity and co-polar correlation coefficient at low levels (mostly below the environmental 0C level). New insights include increasing vertical alignment of the storm mesocyclone with increasing hail size and a Doppler velocity spectrum width minimum aloft near storm center that increases in area with increasing hail size and is argued to indicate increasing updraft width. To complement the extensive radar analysis, near-storm environments from reanalyses are compared and indicate that the greatest environmental differences exist in the middle troposphere (within the hail growth region), especially the wind speed perpendicular to storm motion.

These NN probability forecasts (NNPFs) were produced for HRRR forecasts in 2021-22 using NNs trained with 0000 UTC HRRR forecasts from 2019 to 2020 paired with 1 observed cloud-to-ground (CG1) flash as the target variable. CG1-NNPF skill was evaluated against three baselines: smoothed HRRR-based surrogate lightning forecasts, SPC probabilistic thunderstorm outlooks, and calibrated ensemble thunderstorm guidance from the High-Resolution Ensemble Forecast (HREF) system. The hourly maximum updraft speed (UP) diagnostic was the most skillful HRRR surrogate for predicting CG1, outperforming diagnostics such as hourly maximum lightning threat and updraft helicity. The UP forecasts were compared to the NNPFs by using the most skillful combination of UP threshold and smoothing length scale at each forecast hour. The 4- and 1-h CG1-NNPFs exceeded the skill of the UP forecasts in 2021 for nearly all forecast hours, with reduced skill differences overnight compared to the daytime. The NNPFs exhibited excellent reliability, with slight overforecasting of probabilities overnight. The NNPFs were more skillful than NOAA Storm Prediction Center (SPC) Thunderstorm Outlooks in both 2021 and 2022, especially overnight, while during the daytime, the SPC forecasts had similar or slightly greater skill. Finally, the NNPFs outperformed calibrated thunder guidance from the HREF system evaluated across forecasts in 2022. These findings imply that using NNs for thunderstorm prediction can improve upon existing non-machine learning baselines from deterministic and ensemble systems and may improve operational SPC thunderstorm forecasts.","Sobash et al.

The capabilities to assimilate GLM FED data are first implemented into the GSI-based EnKF data assimilation (DA) system and tested with a mesoscale convective system (MCS).

Overall, both DA experiments outperform CTRL in terms of the analyses and short-term forecasts of FED and composite/3D reflectivity. The assimilation of FED is primarily effective in regions of deep moist convection, which helps improve short-term forecasts of convective threats, including heavy precipitation and lightning.

This is done to illustrate the importance of examining model accuracy across a range of weather phenomena.
Observation and forecast objects were created using the Method for Object-Based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE). HRRR accurately depicted the spatial displacements between observation cloud (defined using BTs) and radar reflectivity objects, namely the centers of cloud objects are to the east of the radar objects for the tornado and derecho events, and generally west of the radar objects for the snow event. However, HRRR had higher (less intense) simulated BTs and higher (more intense) radar reflectivity than the observations for the tornado event. Simulated radar reflectivity is higher and BTs are lower than the observations during the middle of the snow event. Also, simulated radar reflectivity is higher and BTs are lower than the observations during the derecho event.
Of the three weather events, the HRRR forecasts are most accurate for the snow event, based on the Object-based Threat Score, followed by the derecho and tornado events.

In this article, we extend prior analysis to examine the correspondence of various combinations of quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) and precipitation thresholds to observed occurrences of flash floods, additionally considering short-term quantitative precipitation forecasts from a convection-allowing model.

Consistent with previous studies, there is large variability between QPE datasets in the frequency of ""heavy"" precipitation events. There is also large regional variability in the best thresholds for correspondence with reported flash floods. In general, Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) exceedances provide the best correspondence with observed flash floods, although the best correspondence is often found for exceedances of ratios of FFG above or below unity. In the interior western US, NOAA Atlas 14 derived recurrence interval thresholds (for the southwestern US) and static thresholds (for the northern and central Rockies) provide better correspondence.
Six-hour QPE provides better correspondence with observed flash floods than 1-h QPE in all regions except the west coast and southwestern US. Exceedances of precipitation thresholds in forecasts from the operational High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) generally do not correspond with observed flash flood events as well as QPE datasets, but they outperform QPE datasets in some regions of complex terrain and sparse observational coverage such as the southwestern US.

SBTEX contains hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that are released from the petrochemical industry, combustion process, transport emission, and solvent usage sources. Although several SBTEX toxic assessment studies have been conducted, they have mainly relied on ambient measurements to estimate exposure and limit their scope to specific locations and observational periods. To overcome these spatiotemporal limitations, an air quality modeling system over the US Gulf region was created, predicting the spatially and temporally enhanced SBTEX modeling concentrations from May to September 2012. Due to the incompleteness of SBTEX in the official US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emission Inventory (NEI), the Hazardous Air Pollutions Imputation (HAPI) program was used to identify and estimate the missing HAP emissions. The improved emission data were processed to generate the chemically speciated hourly gridded emission inputs for the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) chemical transport model to simulate the SBTEX concentrations over the Gulf modeling region. SBTEX pollutants were modeled using the Reactive Tracer feature in CAMx that accounts for their chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. The data show that the major SBTEX emissions in this region are contributed by mobile emissions (45%), wildfire (30%), and industry (26%). Most SBTEX emissions are emitted during daytime hours (local time 14:00-17:00), and the emission rate in the model domain is about 20-40th1, which is about 4 times higher than that in the nighttime (local time 24:00-04:00, about 4-10th1). High concentrations of SBTEX (above 1ppb) occurred near the cities close to the I-10 interstate highway (Houston, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Mobile) and other metropolitan cities (Shreveport and Dallas). High styrene concentrations were co-located with industrial sources, which contribute the most to the styrene emissions. The HAPI program successfully estimated missing emissions of styrene from the chemical industry. The change increased total styrene emissions by 22%, resulting in maximum ambient concentrations increasing from 0.035 to 1.75ppb across the model domain. The predicted SBTEX concentrations with imputed emissions present good agreement with observational data, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.75 (0.46 to 0.77 for individual SBTEX species) and a normalized mean bias (NMB) of 5.6% (24.9% to 32.1% for the individual SBTEX species), suggesting their value for supporting any SBTEX-related human health studies in the Gulf region.

An additional trace ice footprint was added to FRANA to help forecasters identify areas of light FZRA/FZDZ. A three-year retrospective analysis reveals that FRANA can overestimate or underestimate the icing footprint due to NWP temperature uncertainty, precipitation-type error, radar overshooting, precipitation evaporating below the lowest radar tilt, or due to MRMS quality control. For accumulating ice, FRANA has a modest RMSE of 1.27 mm (0.05 in) and event-maximum errors typically less than 2.54 mm (0.1 in).

To examine how these factors vary across seasons, a seasonal analysis is necessary. However, dividing data by season reduces the sample size, which can affect result reliability and complicate factor comparisons. To address these challenges, this study replaces default parameters with grid search optimization and incorporates cross-validation to mitigate dataset limitations. Using XGBoost with four years of data from the atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM) (Southern Great Plains (SGP) C1 site, cross-validation stabilizes correlation coefficient fluctuations from 0.3 to within 0.1. With optimized parameters, the R value can reach 0.81. Analysis of the C1 site reveals that the relative importance of different factors changes across seasons. Lower tropospheric stability (LTS, ~0.53) is the dominant factor at C1 throughout the year. However, during DJF, latent heat flux (LHF, 0.44) surpasses LTS (0.22). In SON, LTS (0.58) becomes more influential than LHF (0.18). Further comparisons among the four long-term SGP sites (C1, E32, E37, and E39) show seasonal variations in relative importance. Notably, during JJA, the differences in the relative importance of the three factors across all sites are lower than in other seasons. This suggests that boundary layer development in the summer is not dominated by a single factor, reflecting a more intricate process likely influenced by seasonal conditions such as enhanced convective activity, higher temperatures, and humidity, which collectively contribute to a balanced distribution of parameter impacts. Furthermore, the relative importance of LTS gradually increases from morning to noon, indicating that LTS becomes more significant as the boundary layer approaches its maximum height. Consequently, the LTS in the early morning in autumn exhibits greater relative importance compared to other seasons. This reflects a faster development of the mixing layer height (MLH) in autumn, suggesting that it is easier to retrieve the MLH from the previous day during this period.

Perfect bias correction treatments including both the amplitude and the phase are applied to HRRR wind speed, and their impact on WPREs is assessed using categorical performance measures. A large discrepancy in the number of cases with HRRR having much fewer cases than the reference is found, which is attributed to the model's temporal and spatial resolution.

Upper-level divergence associated with the MJO tropical convection drives a quasi-stationary Rossby wave response to the midlatitudes. This forces a midlatitude upper-level dipolar geopotential height anomaly that is accompanied by a westward retraction of the jet stream and reduced rainfall over the central-eastern North Pacific. A reverse effect is found as the MJO propagates eastward across the Maritime Continent. These large differences in the extratropical upper-level flow, combined with anomalies in the regional supply of water vapor, have a profound impact on southeastern U.S. rainfall. The low-frequency variability, including that associated with ENSO, can modify the seasonal background flow (e.g., El Nio and La Nia basic states) affecting the distribution, strength, and propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation and the extratropical teleconnection patterns. The combined effects of the ENSO and the MJO signals result in both spatial and temporal patterns of interference and modulation of North American rainfall. The results from this study show that during a particular phase of an active MJO, the extratropical response can considerably enhance or mask the interannual ENSO signal in the United States, potentially resulting in anomalies of the opposite sign than that expected during a specific ENSO phase.

Recent observational studies suggest that extratropical-tropical coupling between the KE and the central tropical Pacific El Nio Southern Oscillation (CP-ENSO) leads to the observed preferred decadal time-scale of Pacific climate variability. By combining reanalysis data with numerical simulations from a high-resolution climate model and a linear inverse model (LIM), we confirm that KE and CP-ENSO dynamics are linked through extratropical-tropical teleconnections. Specifically, the atmospheric response to the KE excites Meridional Modes that energize the CP-ENSO (extratropicstropics), and in turn, CP-ENSO teleconnections energize the extratropical atmospheric forcing of the KE (tropicsextratropics). However, both observations and the model show that the KE/CP-ENSO coupling is non-stationary and has intensified in recent decades after the mid-1980. Given the short length of the observational and climate model record, it is difficult to attribute this shift to anthropogenic forcing. However, using a large-ensemble of the LIM we show that the intensification in the KE/CP-ENSO coupling after the mid-1980 is significant and linked to changes in the KE atmospheric downstream response, which exhibit a stronger imprint on the subtropical winds that excite the Pacific Meridional modes and CP-ENSO.","Joh et al.

We summarize these phenomena and their physics, which have been revealed by analysis of observations, by experimentation with uncoupled and coupled atmosphere and ocean models with a hierarchy of complexity, and by theoretical developments. We start with a discussion of the seasonal cycle in the equatorial tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which are clearly affected by coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. We then discuss the tropical phenomena that only exist because of the coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean: the Pacific and Atlantic meridional modes, the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific, and a phenomenon analogous to ENSO in the Atlantic. For ENSO, we further discuss the sources of irregularity and asymmetry between warm and cold phases of ENSO, and the response of ENSO to forcing. Fundamental to variability on all time scales in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are preferred patterns of uncoupled atmospheric variability that exist independent of any changes in the state of the ocean, land, or distribution of sea ice. These patterns include the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern; they are most active in wintertime, with a temporal spectrum that is nearly white. Stochastic variability in the NPO, PNA, and NAO force the ocean on days to interannual times scales by way of turbulent heat exchange and Ekman transport, and on decadal and longer time scales by way of wind stress forcing. The PNA is partially responsible for the Pacific decadal oscillation; the NAO is responsible for an analogous phenomenon in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. In models, stochastic forcing by the NAO also gives rise to variability in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) that is partially responsible for multidecadal anomalies in the North Atlantic climate known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO); observations do not yet exist to adequately determine the physics of the AMO. We review the progress that has been made in the past 50 years in understanding each of these phenomena and the implications for short-term (seasonal-to-interannual) climate forecasts.

Here, composite analyses using tide gauge data from six coastal regions along the East and West Coasts of the U.S. reveal influences on sea level anomalies from both the MJO and ENSO. Tropical MJO deep convection forces a signal that results in U.S. coastal sea levels anomalies that vary based on MJO phase. Further, ENSO is shown to modulate both the MJO sea level response and background state of the teleconnections. The sea level anomalies can be significantly enhanced or weakened by the MJO-associated anomaly along the East Coast due to constructive or destructive interference with the ENSO-associated anomaly, respectively. The West Coast anomaly is found to be dominated by ENSO.

Both a dry linear baroclinic model and a dry nonlinear baroclinic model are employed to (1) assess how much of the MJO teleconnection pattern in a particular ENSO phase can be captured by linear and nonlinear dynamics and (2) analyze the role of the ENSO-modulated MJO forcing and base state in reproducing the teleconnection patterns. The modeling experiments reveal that linear dynamics are sufficient in capturing differences between the Northern Hemisphere teleconnections associated with the MJO during El Nio and La Nia. Nonlinear dynamics modestly capture more of the Northern Hemisphere MJO teleconnection pattern, particularly over North America, suggesting the teleconnection response over North America is more complex. The teleconnection patterns are sensitive to changes in both the ENSO background state and the domain of the monthly MJO-associated forcing. A Rossby wave source diagnosis is applied to further understand the underlying mechanisms. Further, a series of experiments swapping MJO forcings during El Nio events versus La Nia events with an ENSO-neutral base state and vice versa show that the MJO forcing has a larger influence over the teleconnection pattern than the base state.

The LIM provides a means of calculating the response of a dynamical system to a small forcing by constructing a linear operator from the observed covariability statistics of the system. Given the linear assumptions, it is shown that the PNA is one of a few leading modes over the extratropical Pacific that can be strongly driven by tropical convection while other extratropical modes present at most a weak interaction with tropical convection. In the second part of this study, a two-step linear regression is introduced that leverages a LIM and large-scale climate variability to the prediction of hydrological extremes (e.g., atmospheric rivers) on subseasonal time scales.

However, the potential predictive skill gained from stratospheric variability can be limited by biases in the representation of stratospheric processes and the coupling of the stratosphere with surface climate in forecast systems. This study provides a first systematic identification of model biases in the stratosphere across a wide range of subseasonal forecast systems.

It is found that many of the forecast systems considered exhibit warm global-mean temperature biases from the lower to middle stratosphere, too strong/cold wintertime polar vortices, and too cold extratropical upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere regions. Furthermore, tropical stratospheric anomalies associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation tend to decay toward each system's climatology with lead time. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), most systems do not capture the seasonal cycle of extreme-vortex-event probabilities, with an underestimation of sudden stratospheric warming events and an overestimation of strong vortex events in January. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), springtime interannual variability in the polar vortex is generally underestimated, but the timing of the final breakdown of the polar vortex often happens too early in many of the prediction systems.

These stratospheric biases tend to be considerably worse in systems with lower model lid heights. In both hemispheres, most systems with low-top atmospheric models also consistently underestimate the upward wave driving that affects the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex.

This study leverages these existing (baseline) prototypes to isolate the impact of substituting (one-at-a-time) parameterizations for convection, microphysics, and planetary boundary layer on 35-day forecasts. Through these physics sensitivity experiments, it is found that no particular configuration of the subseasonal-length coupled model is uniformly better or worse, based on several metrics including mean-state biases and skill scores for the Madden-Julian Oscillation, precipitation, and 2-m temperature. Importantly, the spatial patterns of many ""first-order"" biases (e.g., impact of convection on precipitation) are remarkably similar between the end of the first week and weeks 3-4, indicating that some subseasonal biases may be mitigated through tuning at shorter timescales. This result, while shown for the first time in the context of subseasonal prediction with different physics schemes, is consistent with findings in climate models that some mean-state biases evident in multi-year averages can manifest in only a few days.

Thus it is important for stakeholders to be informed of approaching periods of increased or decreased cyclone activity. While individual cyclone tracks can be predicted out to about a week or so, from week 2 on, statistics summarizing cyclone activity, or storminess, are more useful. Storminess can be defined based on Lagrangian cyclone tracking or by Eulerian variance statistics. The outlook includes a combination of both methods. Lagrangian cyclone tracks provide information about where cyclones pass through and are more intuitive to users, while Eulerian variance statistics have been shown to be highly correlated with cyclone-related weather and are expected to be more predictable given that they are not as noisy. In this paper, we evaluate a storminess outlook tool developed based on dynamical model forecasts in the week-2 and weeks 3-4 time ranges. The outlook uses two 6-hourly subseasonal ensemble forecasts-the Global Ensemble Forecast System version 12 (GEFSv12), and the coupled Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). Hindcasts and operational forecasts from 1999-2016 are used to assess the prediction skill. Our results show that the GEFSv12 and CFSv2 combined ensemble has higher skill than either individual ensemble. The combined ensemble shows some skill in predicting cyclone amplitude and frequency out to weeks 3-4, with highest skill in winter, and lowest skill in summer. Models also show some skill in predicting the statistics of deep cyclones for week 2. The prediction skills for an Eulerian sea level pressure variance storminess metric is significantly higher than those for Lagrangian track statistics.

Metrics used to quantify land-heat coupling in the current climate, relating sensible heat fluxes to near-surface air temperature, are applied to multimodel simulations of the past, present, and future climate to investigate the evolving role of land-atmosphere feedbacks in cases of extreme heat. Two related metrics are used: one that describes the climatological state of land-heat coupling and one that gives an episodic estimate of land feedbacks, here defined as the metric's value at the 90th percentile of monthly mean temperatures. To provide robust statistics, seasonal multimodel medians are calculated, with the significance of changes determined by the degree of model consensus on the sign of the change. The climatological land-heat coupling mirrors other metrics of land-atmosphere interaction, peaking in transition regions between arid and humid climates. Changes from preindustrial to recent historical conditions are dominated by decreased land surface controls on extreme heat, mainly over the broad areas that have experienced expanded or intensified agriculture over the last 150 years. Future projections for increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations show a waning of areas of weakened land-heat feedbacks, while areas of increasing feedbacks expand over monsoon regions and much of the midlatitudes. The episodic land-heat metric is based on anomalies, which creates a quandary: how should anomalies be defined in a nonstationary climate? When the episodic coupling is defined relative to the means and variances for each period, a broadly similar evolution to the climatological metric is found, with historically dominant decreases giving way to widespread moderate increases in future climate scenarios. Basing all statistics on preindustrial norms results in huge increases in the coupling metric, showing its sensitivity to the definition of anomalies.

Using the GFDL SPEAR S2S prediction system, we evaluate the BSISO prediction skills based on 20-yr (2000-19) hindcast experiments with initializations from May to October. It is revealed that the overall BSISO prediction skill using all hindcasts reaches out to 22 days as measured by BSISO indices before the bivariate anomalous correlation coefficient (ACC) drops below 0.5. Results also show that the northeastward-propagating canonical BSISO (CB) event has a higher prediction skill than the northward dipole BSISO (DB) event (28 vs 23 days). This is attributed to CB's more periodic nature, resulting in its longer persistence, while DB events are more episodic accompanied by a rapid demise after reaching maximum enhanced convection over the equatorial Indian Ocean. From a forecaster's perspective, a precursory strong Kelvin wave component in the equatorial western Pacific signifies the subsequent development of a CB event, which is likely more predictable. Investigation of individual CB events shows a large interevent spread in terms of their prediction skills. For CB, the events with weaker and fluctuating amplitude during their lifetime have relatively lower prediction skills likely linked to their weaker convection-circulation coupling. Interestingly, the prediction skills of individual CB events tend to be relatively higher and less scattered during late summer (August-October) than those in early summer (May-July), suggestive of the seasonal modulation on the evolution and predictability of BSISO.","Xiang et al.

These issues have motivated the development of spatial filtering and neighborhood postprocessing methods, such as fractional coverage and neighborhood maximum value, which address this spatial uncertainty. Two different fractional coverage approaches for the generation of gridpoint probabilities were evaluated. The first method expands the traditional point probability calculation to cover a 100-km radius around a given point. The second method applies the idea that a uniform radius is not appropriate when there is strong agreement between members. In such cases, the traditional fractional coverage approach can reduce the probabilities for these potentially well-handled events. Therefore, a variable radius approach has been developed based upon ensemble agreement scale similarity criteria. In this method, the radius size ranges from 10 km for member forecasts that are in good agreement (e.g., lake-effect snow, orographic precipitation, very short-term forecasts, etc.) to 100 km when the members are more dissimilar.

Evidence is presented based on diagnosis of the model forecasts that the dynamics during the early evening boundary layer transition are, in large part, responsible for the behavior of the hodographs at that time: as vertical mixing in the boundary layer diminishes, the drag on the wind at anemometer level persists, leading to rapid deceleration of the meridional component of the wind.

Since 2007, the number of CAMs (including CAM ensembles) examined in the SFEs has increased dramatically, peaking at six different CAM ensembles in 2015. Meanwhile, major advances have been made in creating, importing, processing, verifying, and developing tools for analyzing and visualizing these large and complex datasets. However, progress toward identifying optimal CAM ensemble configurations has been inhibited because the different CAM systems have been independently designed, making it difficult to attribute differences in performance characteristics. Thus, for the 2016 SFE, a much more coordinated effort among many collaborators was made by agreeing on a set of model specifications (e.g., model version, grid spacing, domain size, and physics) so that the simulations contributed by each collaborator could be combined to form one large, carefully designed ensemble known as the Community Leveraged Unified Ensemble (CLUE). The 2016 CLUE was composed of 65 members contributed by five research institutions and represents an unprecedented effort to enable an evidence-driven decision process to help guide NOAA's operational modeling efforts. Eight unique experiments were designed within the CLUE framework to examine issues directly relevant to the design of NOAA's future operational CAM-based ensembles.

Hail size forecasts diagnosed using the Thompson hail algorithm and storm surrogates predict hail coverage. For this case hail forecasts predict the coverage of hail with a high level of skill but underpredict hail size. The storm surrogate updraft helicity predicts the coverage of severe hail with the most skill for this case. Model data are analyzed to assess the effects of microphysical treatments related to rimed ice. THO uses diagnostic equations to increase the size of graupel within the hail core. MOR-G and MOR-H predict small rimed ice aloft; excessive size sorting and increased fall speeds cause MOR-H to predict more and larger surface hail than MOR-G. The MY2 and NSSL schemes predict large, dense rimed ice particles because both schemes predict separate hail and graupel categories.

These forecasts, using WRF-ARW and Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model on the B-grid (NMMB) in 2016, and WRF-ARW and GFDL Finite Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3) in 2017, covered the contiguous United States at 3-km horizontal grid spacing, and supported the generation and evaluation of precipitation forecast products, including ensemble probabilistic products. Forecasts of 3-h precipitation accumulation are evaluated. Overall, the SSEF produces skillful 3-h accumulated precipitation forecasts, with ARW members generally outperforming NMMB members and the single FV3 member run in 2017 outperforming ARW members; these differences are significant at some forecast hours. Statistically significant differences exist in the performance, in terms of bias and ETS, among subensembles of members sharing common microphysics and PBL schemes. Year-to-year consistency is higher for PBL subensembles than for microphysical subensembles. Probability-matched (PM) ensemble mean forecasts outperform individual members, while the simple ensemble mean exhibits substantial bias.

Using input data from the NSSL Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS), we explore how the LSR and MESH severe hail climatologies compare in WoFS and the variation in model performance with the choices of target variable for training and testing. Regardless of the training target variable, all ML models performed better when evaluated on MESH. The improved performance of the LSR-trained model on MESH was attributed to MESH better capturing nighttime events, which reduced spurious false alarms compared to evaluating LSRs only. However, the best model for a given target variable was the one trained on that target variable. For example, when evaluating LSRs, the LSR-trained model performed best. This has operational significance as MESH-trained models may underperform LSR-trained models if the target variable is LSRs. We attribute the better MESH scores to MESH being more spatially and temporally consistent with WoFS versus LSRs. Nevertheless, whether either approach better predicts severe hail occurrence is still to be determined. Last, combining MESH and LSRs did not significantly improve model performance, which may be attributed to the fact that both datasets have unique error sources that do not cancel out. Ultimately, the main goal of this study is to shed light on the broader implications of data choice in the training and verification of ML models.","Flora et al.

Systematic verification demonstrated that BothVTS matched the DA spread and accuracy of the best performing individual component VTS. Ten-member forecasts showed BothVTS performs similarly to ConVTS, with RadVTS having better skill in 1-h precipitation at forecast hours 1-6 while Both/ConVTS had better skill at later hours 7-15.

This study utilizes EFSO to estimate relative impacts of nonconventional surface observations against conventional observations, and further incorporates assimilated radar observations into EFSO. Results show that, when applying advected localization and a neighborhood upscale averaging technique, EFSO estimates remain correlated and skillful with the actual error reduction of all assimilated observations for the duration of 2-h forecasts. The ability for EFSO to verify against other metrics (surface T, u, v, q) beside energy norms is also demonstrated, emphasizing that EFSO can be used to evaluate impacts of specific parts of the forecast system rather than integrated quantities.

In this study, we examine the uncertainty features of HRRR QPFs for an Iowa flooding event that occurred in September 2016. Our evaluation of HRRR QPFs is based on the conventional approach of QPF verification and the analysis of mean areal precipitation (MAP) with respect to forecast lead time. The QPF verification results show that the precipitation forecast skill of HRRR significantly drops during short lead times and then gradually decreases for further lead times. The MAP analysis also demonstrates that the QPF error sharply increases during short lead times and starts decreasing slightly beyond 4-h lead time. We found that the variability of QPF error measured in terms of MAP decreases as basin scale and lead time become larger and longer, respectively. The effects of QPF uncertainty on hydrologic prediction are quantified through the hillslope-link model (HLM) simulations using hydrologic performance metrics (e.g., Kling-Gupta efficiency). The simulation results agree to some degree with those from the MAP analysis, finding that the performance achieved from the QPF forcing decreases during 1-3-h lead times and starts increasing with 4-6-h lead times. The best performance acquired at the 1-h lead time does not seem acceptable because of the large overestimation of the flood peak, along with an erroneous early peak that is not observed in streamflow observations.

Multischeme and parameter sensitivity experiments are conducted. Measurements of overlake fluxes and downwind snowfall are used to evaluate the simulations. Consistent with previous studies, LeS is found to be strongly sensitive to SL and PBL parameterization choices. Simulated precipitation accumulations differ by up to a factor of 2 depending on the schemes used. Differences between SL schemes are the dominant source of this sensitivity. Parameterized surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat can each vary by over 100 W m2 between SL schemes. The magnitude of these fluxes is correlated with the amount of downwind precipitation. Differences between PBL schemes play a secondary role, but have notable impacts on storm morphology. Many schemes produce credible simulations of overlake fluxes and downwind snowfall.

Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) in Utah's Wasatch Range frequently experiences high-impact winter storms and avalanche closures that result in substantial transportation and economic disruptions, making it an excellent testbed for evaluating snowfall forecasts. In this study, we validate QPFs, SLR forecasts, and QSFs produced by or derived from the Global Forecast System (GFS) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) using liquid precipitation equivalent (LPE) and snowfall observations collected during the 2019/20-2022/23 cool seasons at the Alta-Collins snow-study site (2945 m MSL) in upper LCC. The 12-h QPFs produced by the GFS and HRRR underpredict the total LPE during the four cool seasons by 33% and 29%, respectively, and underpredict 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile event frequencies. Current operational SLR methods exhibit mean absolute errors of 4.5-7.7. In contrast, a locally trained random forest algorithm reduces SLR mean absolute errors to 3.7. Despite the random forest producing more accurate SLR forecasts, QSFs derived from operational SLR methods produce higher critical success indices since they exhibit positive SLR biases that offset negative QPF biases.

A suite of 20-member ensemble simulations are run, including ensembles where SPP is applied only to PBL/SL or MP, where SPP is applied to multiple schemes concurrently, where perturbations to initial and boundary conditions (ICs/BCs) are applied instead of SPP, and where SPP and IC/BC perturbations are applied together.

Such rapid changes in the lake-surface conditions are not accounted for in existing operational weather forecast models, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, resulting in reduced performance of lake-effect snow forecasts. As a milestone to future implementations in the Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) and HRRR, this study examines the one-way linkage between the hydrodynamic-ice model [the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model coupled with the unstructured grid version of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (FVCOM-CICE), the physical core model of GLOFS] and the atmospheric model [the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, the physical core model of HRRR]. The realistic representation of lake-surface cooling and ice development or its fractional coverage during three lake-effect snow events was achieved by feeding the FVCOM-CICE simulated lake-surface conditions to WRF (using a regional configuration of HRRR), resulting in the improved simulation of the turbulent heat fluxes over the lakes and resulting snow water equivalent in the downwind areas.

A representative case is chosen to diagnose the cause for each of these biases using sensitivity simulations with different physics combinations or modified parameters and verified with additional mesonet observations. The cold bias in the Northeast US is attributed to aspects of the NOAH-MP LSM over snow cover, where NOAH-MP simulates lower soil water content, and thus lower thermal conductivity than other LSMs, leading to less upward ground heat flux during nighttime and consequently lower surface temperature.

Traditionally, airborne observations provide the best information about the surface wind speeds, with the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) providing a key role in obtaining such data. However, the flight patterns conducted by hurricane hunter aircraft are limited in their azimuthal coverage of the surface wind field, resulting in an undersampling of the wind field and consequent underestimation of the peak 10-m wind speed. A previous study provided quantitative estimates of the average underestimate for a very strong hurricane. However, no broader guidance on applying a correction based on undersampling has been presented in detail. To accomplish this task, a modified observing system simulation experiment with five hurricane simulations is used to perform a statistical evaluation of the peak wind speed underestimate over different stages of the tropical cyclone life cycle. Analysis of numerous simulated flights highlights prominent relationships between wind speed undersampling and storm size, where size is defined by the radius of maximum wind speed (RMW). For example, an intense hurricane with small RMW needs negligible correction, while a large-RMW tropical storm requires a 16%-19% change.

This study compares operational and retrospective forecasts from three configurations of NCEP's Global Forecast System (GFS) to quantify the impact of model upgrades on TC genesis forecasts. First, bulk verification statistics from a homogeneous sample of model initialization cycles during the period 2013-14 are compared. Then, composites of select output fields are analyzed in an attempt to identify any key differences between hit and false alarm events. Bulk statistics indicate that TC genesis forecast performance decreasedwith the implementation of the 2015 version of theGFS, but thenmodestly recoveredwith the 2016 version of the model. In addition, the composite analysis suggests that false alarm forecasts in the 2015 version of theGFSmay have been the result of inaccurately forecasting the location and/or strength of upper-level troughs poleward of the TC.

In particular, false alarm RI forecasts are notably high, driving down forecast skill despite higher RI detection rates. RI forecast improvement will be achieved by identifying spatial patterns distinct to RI false alarm cases that help distinguish them from correctly forecast RI events. A previously developed machine learning ensemble was used to hindcast on a database of Atlantic TCs spanning 1999 - 2016 to identify false alarm RI forecasts, as well as correct RI forecasts. Each set of cases (correct and false alarm) was used to develop kernel principal component (KPC) based composites of important meteorological features within RI TCs to facilitate meteorological comparisons against correctly forecast events.

The full record of TRMM data (1998-2013) including 2326 TMI overpasses of 503 TCs is separated into dependent samples (1998-2010) for model development and independent samples (2011-13) for model verification.

This study provides a substantial update to that prior work by analyzing a more recent period (2017-22) with one additional model [Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM)], expanding the forecast period temporally to 7 days, and expanding the study domain spatially to include all basins [except the central North Pacific (CP) basin, where the sample size of TC genesis events was too small to generate meaningful statistics]. TC genesis forecasts from five global models are verified against the NHC's and JTWC's best tracks. Verification statistics exhibit nontrivial interannual and model-to-model variability rendering it unfeasible to attempt to define repeatable performance rankings among the models. Nevertheless, results indicate that the ECMWF model exhibits the largest mean success ratio (SR) overall, while the UKMO and GFS models exhibit the greatest probability of detection (POD). All models exhibit a clear trade-off between SR and POD, yielding mean critical success index values < 0.35 for any individual model and basin.

These plateaus, separated by the narrow Wills Valley, span ~5000 km2 and were impacted by 79 tornadoes from 1992 to 2016. This area represents a relative regional statistical maximum in tornadogenesis, with a particular tendency for tornadogenesis on the northwestern side of Sand Mountain. This exploratory paper investigates storm behavior and possible physical explanations for this density of tornadogenesis events and tornadoes. Long-term surface observation datasets indicate that surface winds tend to be stronger and more backed atop Sand Mountain than over the adjacent Tennessee Valley, potentially indicative of changes in the low-level wind profile supportive to storm rotation. The surface data additionally indicate potentially lower lifting condensation levels over the plateaus versus the adjacent valleys, an attribute previously shown to be favorable for tornadogenesis. Rapid Update Cycle and Rapid Refresh model output indicate that Froude numbers for the plateaus in tornadic environments are likely supportive of enhanced low-level flow over the plateaus, which further indicates the potential for favorable wind profile changes for tornado production.

Efforts to understand terrain effects on tornadoes have been limited in scope, typically examining a small number of cases with limited observations or idealized numerical simulations. One region where topography has been thought to potentially impact tornado frequency is along the Sand Mountain and Lookout Mountain plateaus in northeastern Alabama. It has been suspected that storms often intensify and produce tornadoes upon reaching these plateaus, particularly Sand Mountain. The role of these plateaus in modifying the near-storm environment and storm evolution became a focus of the VORTEX-SE field campaign beginning in Fall 2016. This dissertation investigates the statistics of tornadoes around Sand Mountain and Lookout Mountain and how the near-storm environment evolves atop the plateaus relative to surrounding areas. Results indicate that Sand Mountain and Lookout Mountain form a local statistical maximum in tornadogenesis reports from 1992-2016. Substantial variation can exist in the boundary layer environmental profiles between the plateaus and the Tennessee Valley. Significant horizontal variability in flow exists over Sand Mountain, particularly along the northwestern edge. Storm-relative helicity (SRH) can be enhanced atop the plateaus, particularly when the upstream mountain Froude number is supportive of parcels moving over the plateaus as opposed to being blocked. In addition, a downslope wind enhancement along the northwestern slope of Sand Mountain can develop, which can serve to further enhance SRH on the northwestern portion of Sand Mountain. Lifting condensation level (LCL) heights are nearly ubiquitously lower relative to ground level atop the plateaus than in the valley. This dissertation describes the evidence supporting these effects, as well as potential caveats to these findings. How these environmental variations may impact storm evolution are described, including an assessment of preliminary observations of supercell rear-flank downdraft buoyancy changes that may be related to the observed LCL height differences. Operational impacts of these results are discussed. The final product is a refined hypothesis of how the plateaus impact the near-storm environment of potentially tornadic storms in northeastern Alabama and suggested future work toward understanding the terrain-related near-storm environmental variations and storm-scale effects.","Lyza (2019)","Wed Apr 01 2020 03:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)","https://louis.uah.edu/uah-dissertations/165","","","","","","","","","an initial investigation of the role of the northeastern alabama plateaus in modifying the near-storm environment of potentially tornadic storms, the effects of terrain on tornadoes are poorly understood. efforts to understand terrain effects on tornadoes have been limited in scope, typically examining a small number of cases with limited observations or idealized numerical simulations. one region where topography has been thought to potentially impact tornado frequency is along the sand mountain and lookout mountain plateaus in northeastern alabama. it has been suspected that storms often intensify and produce tornadoes upon reaching these plateaus, particularly sand mountain. the role of these plateaus in modifying the near-storm environment and storm evolution became a focus of the vortex-se field campaign beginning in fall 2016. this dissertation investigates the statistics of tornadoes around sand mountain and lookout mountain and how the near-storm environment evolves atop the plateaus relative to surrounding areas. results indicate that sand mountain and lookout mountain form a local statistical maximum in tornadogenesis reports from 1992-2016. substantial variation can exist in the boundary layer environmental profiles between the plateaus and the tennessee valley. significant horizontal variability in flow exists over sand mountain, particularly along the northwestern edge. storm-relative helicity (srh) can be enhanced atop the plateaus, particularly when the upstream mountain froude number is supportive of parcels moving over the plateaus as opposed to being blocked. in addition, a downslope wind enhancement along the northwestern slope of sand mountain can develop, which can serve to further enhance srh on the northwestern portion of sand mountain. lifting condensation level (lcl) heights are nearly ubiquitously lower relative to ground level atop the plateaus than in the valley. this dissertation describes the evidence supporting these effects, as well as potential caveats to these findings. how these environmental variations may impact storm evolution are described, including an assessment of preliminary observations of supercell rear-flank downdraft buoyancy changes that may be related to the observed lcl height differences. operational impacts of these results are discussed. the final product is a refined hypothesis of how the plateaus impact the near-storm environment of potentially tornadic storms in northeastern alabama and suggested future work toward understanding the terrain-related near-storm environmental variations and storm-scale effects.","The effects of terrain on tornadoes are poorly understood.

Foci of VORTEX-SE include the characterization of the tornadic environments specific to the Southeast US as well as societal response to forecasts and warnings. Among several experiments, a research team from Purdue University and from the University of Massachusetts Amherst deployed a mobile S-band Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar and a co-located Vaisala CL31 ceilometer for a period of eight weeks near Belle Mina, AL. Portable disdrometers (DSDs) were also deployed in the same area by Purdue University, occasionally co-located with the radar and lidar. The NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory also deployed the Collaborative Lower Atmosphere Mobile Profiling System (CLAMPS) consisting of a Doppler lidar, a microwave radiometer, and an infrared spectrometer. The purpose of these profiling instruments was to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer evolution over the course of the experiment. In this paper we focus on the lidar-based retrieval of rainfall rate (RR) and its limitations using observations from intensive observation periods during the experiment: 31 March and 29 April 2016. Departing from Lewandowski et al., 2009, the RR was estimated by the Vaisala CL31 ceilometer applying the slope method (Kunz and Leeuw, 1993) to invert the extinction caused by the rain. Extinction retrievals are fitted against RR estimates from the disdrometer in order to derive a correlation model that allows us to estimate the RR from the ceilometer in similar situations without a disdrometer permanently deployed. The problem of extinction retrieval is also studied from the perspective of Klett-Fernald-Sasano's (KFS) lidar inversion algorithm (Klett, 1981; 1985), which requires the assumption of an aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio (the so-called lidar ratio) and calibration in a molecular reference range. The latter is hampered by the limited dynamic range of the ceilometer under rain events, which usually makes it difficult to properly record the reference-range interval. The RR is also compared to estimates by the FMCW radar, which provides vertical profiles of reflectivity and Doppler spectra, from which DSDs and rainfall rates can be inferred more directly. Ceilometer-derived RRs are compared with RR radar estimates for the same days in order to identify pros and cons of the proposed approach. Following Westbrook et al. (2010), we also consider the estimation of rain rates using two-color lidar, which is limited to drizzle and low rain rates.

This approach is based purely on data, exploits elevation and population information explicitly in the vicinity of each tornado, and enables an explicit test of the dependence of results on elevation roughness length scale. A simple log-link linear regression fit to this empirical distribution yields an 11% decrease in tornado probability per 10-m increase in elevation roughness at fixed population density for large elevation roughness length scales (15-20 km). This effect increases by at least a factor of 2 moving toward smaller length scales down to 1 km. The elevation effect exhibits no time trend, while the population bias effect decreases systematically in time, consistent with the improvement of reporting practices. Results are robust across time periods and the exclusion of EF1 tornadoes and are consistent with recent county-level and gridded analyses.

A less documented class of vortices are horizontally-oriented vortex tubes near and/or wrapping about tornadoes, that are observed either visually or in high-resolution Doppler radar data. In this study, an idealized numerical simulation of a tornadic supercell at 100 m grid spacing is used to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) structure and kinematics of horizontal vortices (HVs) that interact with a simulated tornado. Visualizations based on direct volume rendering aided by visual observations of HVs in a real tornado reveal the existence of a complex distribution of 3D vortex tubes surrounding the tornadic flow throughout the simulation.

Accurate precipitation downscaling in the United States Great Plains remains a great challenge for most Regional Climate Models, particularly for warm months. Most previous dynamic downscaling simulations significantly underestimate warm-season precipitation in the region. This study aims to achieve a better precipitation downscaling in the Great Plains with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. To this end, WRF simulations with different physics schemes and nudging strategies are first conducted for a representative warm season. Results show that different cumulus schemes lead to more pronounced difference in simulated precipitation than other tested physics schemes. Simply choosing different physics schemes is not enough to alleviate the dry bias over the southern Great Plains, which is related to an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the central and western parts of continental U.S. in the simulations. Spectral nudging emerges as an effective solution for alleviating the precipitation bias. Spectral nudging ensures that large and synoptic-scale circulations are faithfully reproduced while still allowing WRF to develop small-scale dynamics, thus effectively suppressing the large-scale circulation anomaly in the downscaling. As a result, a better precipitation downscaling is achieved. With the carefully validated configurations, WRF downscaling is conducted for 1980-2015. The downscaling captures well the spatial distribution of monthly climatology precipitation and the monthly/yearly variability, showing improvement over at least two previously published precipitation downscaling studies.

Precisely why they are weak and short lived is not well understood, although recent work suggests that QLCS updraft width may act as a limitation to tornado intensity. Herein, idealized simulations of tornadic QLCSs are performed with variations in hodograph shape and length as well as initiation mechanism to determine the controls of tornado intensity. Generally, the addition of hodograph curvature in these experiments results in stronger, longer-lived tornadic-like vortices (TLVs). A strong correlation between low-level mesocyclone width and TLV intensity is identified (R2 = 0.61), with a weaker correlation in the low-level updraft intensity (R2 = 0.41). The tilt and depth of the updraft are found to have little correlation to tornado intensity. Comparing QLCS and isolated supercell updrafts within these simulations, the QLCS updrafts are less persistent, with the standard deviations of low-level vertical velocity and updraft helicity approximately 48% and 117% greater, respectively. A forcing decomposition reveals that the QLCS cold pool plays a direct role in the development of the low-level updraft, providing the benefit of additional forcing for ascent while also having potentially deleterious effects on both the low-level updraft and near-surface rotation.

As a case study, the relative roles of direct insolation and near-surface moisture advection in the recovery CAPE on 31 March 2016 in northern Alabama are examined using VORTEX-Southeast (VORTEX-SE) observations and numerical simulations. In between rounds of non-tornadic morning storms and tornadic evening storms, CAPE over the VORTEX-SE domain increased from near zero to at least 500 J kg1. A timeline of the day's events is provided with a focus on the evolution of the lower levels of the atmosphere. We focus on its responses to solar insolation and moisture advection, which we hypothesize as the main mechanisms behind the recovery of CAPE. Data from the University of Massachusetts S-Band frequency-modulated, continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Collaborative Lower Atmospheric Mobile Profiling System (CLAMPS), and high-resolution EnKF analyses from the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) are used to characterize the boundary layer evolution in the pre-tornadic storm environment.

Observational data from a WSR-88D and the Oklahoma lightning mapping array are used to map the temporal variance of polarimetric signatures and VHF sources from lightning channels. It is shown, via three-dimensional and cross-sectional analyses, that the storm was of inverted polarity resulting from anomalous electrification. Statistical analysis confirms that mean flash area in the ZDR column region was 10 times smaller than elsewhere in the storm. On an average, 5 times more flash initiations occurred within ZDR column regions, thereby supporting existing theory of an inverse relationship between flash initiation rates and lightning channel extent. Segmentation and object identification algorithms are applied to gridded radar data to calculate metrics such as height, width, and volume of ZDR and KDP columns. Variability in lightning flash rates is best explained by the fluctuations in ZDR column volume with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient value of 0.72. The highest flash rates occur in conjunction with the deepest ZDR columns (up to 5 km above environmental melting level) and largest volumes of ZDR columns extending up to the 20C level (3 km above the melting level). Reduced flash rates toward the end of the analysis are indicative of weaker updrafts manifested as low ZDR column volumes at and above the 10C level.

In this study, we track rapid fluctuations in updraft intensity and size by objectively identifying polarimetric fingerprints such as Z DR and K DP columns, which serve as proxies for mixed-phase updraft strength. We quantify the volume of Z DR and K DP columns to evaluate their utility in diagnosing temporal variability in lightning flash characteristics. Specifically, we analyze three severe storms that developed in environments with low-to-moderate instability and strong 0-6-km wind shear in northern Alabama during the 2016-17 VORTEX-Southeast field campaign. In these three cases (a tornadic supercell embedded in stratiform precipitation, a nontornadic supercell, and a supercell embedded within a quasi-linear convective system), we find that the volume of the K DP columns exhibits a stronger correlation with the total flash rate. The higher covariability of the K DP column volume with the total flash rate suggests that the overall electrification and precipitation microphysics were dominated by cold cloud processes. The lower covariability with the Z DR column volume indicates the presence of nonsteady updrafts or a less prominent role of warm rain processes in graupel growth and subsequent electrification.

This included 214, 213, and 103 tornadoes that occurred during 2019, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As a function of tornadogenesis process, 36% were classified as SID, and 60% were classified as PMD; the remaining 4% could not be classified. Approximately 30% of the SID cases were operationally warned prior to tornadogenesis, compared to 44% of the PMD cases. PMD tornadoes were also more common during the warm season and displayed a diurnal, midafternoon peak in frequency. Finally, SID cases were more likely to be associated with QLCS tornado outbreaks but tended to be slightly shorter lived. A complementary effort to investigate environmental characteristics of QLCS tornadogenesis revealed differences between SID and PMD cases. MLCAPE was relatively larger for warm-season SID cases, and 0-3-km SRH was relatively larger in warm-season PMD cases. Additionally, pre-tornadic frontogenesis was more prominent for cool-season SID cases, suggestive of a more significant role of the larger-scale meteorological forcing in vertical vorticity that fosters tornadogenesis through SID processes.","Goodnight et al.

An alternative system is being researched at National Severe Storms Laboratory to issue Probabilistic Hazard Information (PHI). This study investigated how providing the uncertainty information about the tornado occurrence through PHI changes people's protective actions. In an experiment, visual displays of the probabilistic information and deterministic warnings were presented to fifty participants to report their expected protective actions in different scenarios. It was found that the percentage of people who expected to immediately take shelter right after receiving the weather information increased exponentially as their proximity to the threat decreased. When there was more chance that the information about occurrence of a particular tornado was false rather than true, in scenarios that the likelihood of the threat occurrence was less than 50%, providing it through PHI lowered the percentage of people who immediately took shelter.

Accordingly, researchers and administrators at the NWS increasingly recognize a need to supplement verification statistics with complementary data about society in performance management and evaluation. This will require significant development of new capacities to both conceptualize relevant criteria and measure them using consistent, transparent, replicable, and reliable measures that permit generalizable inference to populations of interest. In this study, we contribute to this development by suggesting three criteria that require measurement (forecast and warning reception, comprehension, and response) and demonstrating a methodology that allows us to measure these concepts in a single information domain-tornado warnings. The methodology we employ improves upon previous research in multiple ways. It provides a more generalizable approach to measurement using a temporally consistent set of survey questions that are applicable across the United States; it relies on a more robust set of psychometric tests to analytically demonstrate the reliability of the measures; and it is more transparent and replicable than previous research because the data and methods (source code) are publicly available.

In addition, it explores how different combinations of the categorical labels with numeric information may impact public reactions to the product. Survey data comes from the 2020 Severe Weather and Society Survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults. Participants were shown varying combinations of the information formats of interest, and then rated their concern about the weather and the likelihood of changing plans in response to the given information. Results indicate that providing numeric information (in the form of levels or probabilities) increases the likelihood of participants correctly interpreting the convective outlook information relative to categorical labels alone.

Finally, findings indicate participants' numeracy (or their ability to understand and work with numbers) had an impact on correct interpretation of the order of the outlook labels.

Evidence suggests that resulting inconsistency may reduce user trust. However, adding an uncertainty estimate to the forecast may attenuate any loss of trust due to forecast inconsistency as has been shown with forecast inaccuracy. To evaluate this hypothesis, the experiment reported here, tested the impact on trust of adding probabilistic snow accumulation forecasts to single value forecasts in a series of original and revised forecast pairs (based on historical records) that varied in both consistency and accuracy. Participants rated their trust in the forecasts and used them to make school closure decisions. Half of participants received single-value forecasts and half also received the probability of 6 or more inches (decision threshold in the assigned task). As with previous research, forecast inaccuracy was detrimental to trust although probabilistic forecasts attenuated the effect. Moreover, the inclusion of probabilistic forecasts allowed participants to make economically better decisions. Surprisingly, in this study, inconsistency increased, rather than decreased trust, perhaps because it alerted participants to uncertainty and led them to make more cautious decisions. Furthermore, the positive effect of inconsistency on trust was enhanced by the inclusion of probabilistic forecast.

The designers, alongside NHC staff, sought to identify opportunities to convey tropical cyclone risk information to the public more effectively through internet and mobile technologies. The field of weather risk communication has long used research techniques familiar to designers, including interviews, surveys, and focus groups, to help ensure effective messaging to the public. To the authors' knowledge, designers and design researchers have not been engaged deeply in this problem space until recently. This chapter offers a case study of an attempt to do so. The structure of the project itself is discussed and the approach to navigating some of the particular constraints faced by the NHC.

However, little is known about the diverse population of emergency managers (EMs) and how they receive, process, and use forecast information. The Extreme Weather and Emergency Management Survey (WxEM) aims to fill this knowledge gap by (1) building a nationwide panel of EMs and (2) fielding routine surveys that include questions of relevance to NWS operations. The panel was built by creating a database with contact information from more than 4,000 EMs across the country. An enrollment survey was sent to the list, and over 700 EMs agreed to participate in the project. Following enrollment, WxEM panelists receive surveys that address how EMs use NWS forecast information three to four times a year. These surveys cover a variety of subjects, with the goal of working with other researchers to develop surveys that address their research needs. By collaborating with other research groups to design short, focused surveys, the WxEM project will reduce the research burden on EMs and, at the same time, increase the quality and comparability of research data in the weather enterprise.

Hazards were most common and most harmful in Middle Tennessee and densely populated counties. Chi-square tests identified differences in hazardous and harmful event occurrences between seasons and from day to night. These relationships were further described in a logistic regression model, which indicated that a tornado or nighttime event was significantly more likely to result in reported harm, and a nontornadic thunderstorm wind or summer event was less likely to result in such a report. There are likely some reporting biases that affect these results, for example the underreporting of overnight events that do not cause harm.

NOAA created its VORTEX-Southeast (SE) research program to tackle these unique challenges and integrate them with social science research to increase the survivability of southeastern U.S. weather. As part of VORTEX-SE, this study focused on the severe weather preparation and decision-making of emergency management and, in particular, how uncertainty in severe weather forecasts impacted the relationship between emergency managers (EMs) and weather providers. We conducted in-depth, critical incident background interviews with 35 emergency management personnel across 14 counties. An inductive, data-driven analysis approach revealed several factors contributing to an added layer of practical uncertainty beyond the meteorological forecast uncertainty that impacted and helped to explain the nature of trust in the EM-National Weather Service (NWS) relationship.

First, a meteorological overview of the event is presented, and the ingredients that led to its flash flood-producing rainfall are discussed. Then, two analyses that investigate the relationship between rainfall rates and storm- to mesoscale rotation in the LTC remnants are examined. The first method relies on products from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor system, where two spatial averaging approaches are applied to the 0-2 km accumulated rotation track and gauge bias-corrected quantitative precipitation estimate products over hourly time periods. Using these fields as proxies for rotation and rain rates, the results show a positive spatiotemporal relationship between the two products. The second method time matches subjectively identified radar-based rotation and 5-minute surface rain gauge observations. There, we show that nearly twice the amount of rain was recorded by the gauges when storm- to mesoscale rotation was present nearby, and the differences in 5-minute rainfall observations between when rotation was present versus not was statistically significant.

For forecasters in the National Weather Service (NWS) and their partners in public safety, confidence is central to their work, appearing frequently during their decision support services. While confidence has been examined in a variety of literatures, it is often addressed simplistically or as one of many variables in a study. It is rarely the object of study in and of itself, even less so in a naturalistic setting like an operational environment. To build a more robust knowledge of confidence and its many dimensions, we conducted a multisited ethnography of three interrelated sites central to tornado prediction and information dissemination, leading up to and during a cool-season tornado event. In partnership with collaborators from the NWS and emergency management, we simultaneously deployed to a National Center, a local Weather Forecast Office, and an emergency management office. This article explicates confidence from multiple social science theories, considering the scientific, data-based roots of confidence, as well as its affective, relational, and procedural origins. Our results show that confidence emerges in varied and complex ways and at different scales.

Therefore, it is important to determine whether these residents have anchored their homes and their underlying motivations. This research quantitatively explored various factors influencing Southeast US MMH residents' current anchorage decisions and qualitatively explored other contextual factors for these decisions, including general mitigation knowledge and financial means. Results showed age, insurance, community shelter access, and self-efficacy perceptions reliably distinguished those who have already anchored their homes from those who have not and have no intentions to do so. On the other hand, among those who have not already anchored their homes, only tornado risk perceptions marginally distinguished those with intentions to anchor from those without.

Six cases with different swirl ratios are studied to examine the influence of swirl ratio, while five cases with different radial Reynolds number are studied to investigate the influence of radial Reynolds number. To facilitate the characterization, the core size and rotational speed of subvortices, as well as the relative distance between the subvortex and the core radius of the main vortex, are defined. The results demonstrate that the increase in swirl ratio leads to the increase in the number of subvortices. For the overall vortex, the increase in swirl ratio decreases the maximum tangential velocity but increases the core radius of the overall flow. For subvortices, for the case where four subvortices are produced, the increase in swirl ratio increases the core size of subvortices but decreases the rotational speed of subvortices.

One likely way to increase an individual's behavioral intent to act when they are faced with risk information is to provide protective action information or guidance. This study investigated participant perceptions (understanding, believing, personalizing, deciding, milling, self-efficacy, and response efficacy) in response to the National Weather Service's experimental product Twitter messages for three hazard types (tornado, snow squall, and dust storm), with each message varying by inclusion and presentation of protective action information placed in the tweet text and the visual graphic. We also examine the role of prior hazard warning experience on message perception outcomes. To examine the effects, the experiment used a between-subjects design in which participants were randomly assigned to one hazard type and received one of four warning messages. Participants then took a post-test measuring message perceptions, efficacy levels, prior hazard warning experience, and demographics. The results showed that, for each hazard and prior hazard experience level, messages with protective action guidance in both the text and graphic increase their understanding, belief, ability to decide, self-efficacy, and response efficacy.

Individuals possess a limited number of cognitive resources to allocate to message processing in an emergency. Because of this, they are more likely to allocate attention to messages they are motivated to care about or to message attributes that stand out. In this study, we focus on how warning messages are attended to when they are viewed in a busy media environment and ask the question: ""What does it mean to stand out?"" To address the research questions, we used a sequential explanatory design, mixed-methods approach. We employed eye tracking, a memory exercise, and think-aloud interviews to investigate visual attention, memory, and perceptions in response to warnings communicated via Twitter and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) for snow squall (SS) and dust storm (DS) hazards. Our findings revealed insights to assist message designers as they develop warning messages without burdening the message receiver with contents that require additional cognitive load. Colors help to draw attention to key elements and evoke a feeling of risk. Icons also draw attention and can serve as a signal that catches the eye, especially when actively viewed in a busy messaging environment. Additionally, techniques to make key text stand out through bold or the use of ALL CAPS may reduce effortful processing and eliminate the need for conscious fixations while resulting in easily remembered content.

Current operational WRs do not capture all the variability in the TC surface wind field. In this study, an observational data set of Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) surface wind speeds that are collocated with flight-level predictors is used to analyze the variability of WRs with respect to aircraft altitude and TC storm motion and intensity. The Surface Winds from Aircraft with a Neural Network (SWANN) model is trained on the observations with a custom loss function that prioritizes accurate prediction of relatively rare high-wind observations and minimization of variance in the WRs. The model is capable of learning physical relationships that are consistent with theoretical understanding of the TC boundary layer. Radar-derived wind fields at flight level and independent dropwindsonde in-situ surface wind measurements are used to validate the SWANN model and show improvement over the current operational procedure.

Disaster impact measures were characterized in terms of human lives (i.e., deaths, injured, missing, directly and indirectly, affected, evacuated, relocated), economic (i.e., USD dollars and local currency), damage to infrastructure (e.g., education centers, hospitals, roads, bridges, energy, water supply, and sewage systems), industry (in Central America, mainly agricultural and livestock), different types of disruption caused by the disaster (e.g., school closure days, community isolation time), aid, and many others. The database includes measures of disaster impacts in Guatemala for the period from 2015 to 2021.
The methodology for creating disasters dataset from printed and digital news media is not new and has been used by many multidisciplinary researchers worldwide.

"3","","true","","","","ST&S Open Science Tracker","","Social Science","Measuring Environmental Impacts and Community Perceptions of Cool Roads as a Heat Mitigation Strategy","Many cities around the world, including the City of Phoenix, are experiencing elevated temperatures due to the built environment that are exacerbated by climate change. Paved surfaces with impervious materials, such as asphalt concrete (roads, sidewalks, parking lots, etc.), absorb and store heat during the day and release this heat overnight creating higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.

With paved surfaces comprising about 40% of the urban land area in Phoenix, they are often considered one of the primary causes of the UHI. One of many strategies to mitigate increased temperatures and reduce heat storage in pavements is the use of coatings that reflect (rather than absorb) solar radiation to reduce the heat absorbed by the pavement, thus reducing surface temperatures. Lowering surface temperatures and the heat retained in the built urban environment may help reduce elevated day and nighttime air temperatures. Such reflective coatings are easy to apply to existing paved surfaces and, in most cases, use light-colored pigments and materials to increase reflectivity compared to traditional asphalt concrete roads.

The City of Phoenix recently initiated the Cool Pavement Pilot Program in which the City applied the product CoolSeal by GuardTop to 36 miles of residential neighborhood roads and one public parking lot. This effort resulted in the most miles of road surface coverage with a reflective coating of any municipality globally. It is designed to achieve lower pavement surface temperatures through its lighter color and reflectivity. One neighborhood in each of the eight council districts of Phoenix was chosen for application of CoolSeal in consultation and with the support of the City Council Offices.

Data from the Phoenix Cool Pavement Pilot Program are shared through the DesignSafe Data Depot to be accessed by researchers, municipal officials, and other stakeholders seeking to understand the impacts of this particular heat mitigation strategy and/or who may be considering a similar implementation in their jurisdiction.","Hondula et al.

The existing NAQFC uses climatological chemical lateral boundary conditions (CLBCs), which cannot capture pollutant intrusion events originating outside of the model domain. In this study, we developed a model framework to use dynamic CLBCs from the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS) to drive NAQFC. A mapping of the GEOS chemical species to CMAQ's CB05-AERO6 (Carbon Bond 5; version 6 of the aerosol module) species was developed. The utilization of the GEOS dynamic CLBCs in NAQFC showed the best overall performance in simulating the surface observations during the Saharan dust intrusion and Canadian wildfire events in summer 2015.

Although the effect of CLBCs on the PM2.5 correlation was mainly near the inflow boundary, its impact on the background concentrations reached further inside the domain. The CLBCs could affect background ozone concentrations through the inflows of ozone itself and its precursors, such as CO. It was further found that the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from satellite retrievals correlated well with the column CO and elemental carbon from GEOS. The satellite-derived AOT CLBCs generally improved the model performance for the wildfire intrusion events during a summer 2018 case study and demonstrated how satellite observations of atmospheric composition could be used as an alternative method to capture the air quality effects of intrusions when the CLBCs of global models, such as GEOS CLBCs, are not available.","Tang et al.

Long-term climatology is essential to documenting the dust trend and its response to climate variability. We have reconstructed long-term dust climatology in the western United States, based on a comprehensive dust identification method and continuous aerosol observations from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network. We report here direct evidence of rapid intensification of dust storm activity over American deserts in the past decades (1988-2011), in contrast to reported decreasing trends in Asia and Africa. The frequency of windblown dust storms has increased 240% from 1990s to 2000s. This dust trend is associated with large-scale variations of sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean, with the strongest correlation with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We further investigate the relationship between dust and Valley fever, a fast-rising infectious disease caused by inhaling soil-dwelling fungus (Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii) in the southwestern United States. The frequency of dust storms is found to be correlated with Valley fever incidences, with a coefficient (r) comparable to or stronger than that with other factors believed to control the disease in two endemic centers (Maricopa and Pima County, Arizona). Plain Language Summary Computer models predict that as the Earth warms, the Southwest United States will become drier. In the already arid Southwest, this means more dust storms and even potential environmental catastrophes such as desertification and another Dust Bowl. Using a newly reconstructed data record, we found that indeed this region is seeing more dust storms in the past decades. There was a 240% increase in the number of large dust storms between 1990s and 2000s. The sharp increase of dust storms is likely driven by tiny changes of sea surface temperature in the northern Pacific Ocean. In the Southwest frequented by dust storms, the infection rate of Valley fever has mysteriously gone up more than 800% from 2000 to 2011. Little is known about what drives the fast rise, although a number of factors are found moderately correlated to the outbreaks. In two endemic centers, dust storms are found to better correlated with the disease than any other known controlling factor.

In addition, accurate predictions of air quality can help predict and mitigate the impacts of wildfires on human health, which have an increased risk due to anthropogenic climate change. However, errors in air quality forecasts limit their value in decision-making processes. Thus, increasing the accuracy of air quality forecasts is of significant importance. In this study, we have utilized the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system with a 12 km horizontal grid resolution to generate daily 48-h fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts for the Contiguous United States (CONUS) domain for June 1st through September 29th (major wildfire season) during 2015-2021. We conduct CMAQ offline simulations using meteorological inputs generated by the NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS) numerical weather prediction model. We analyze the performance of the CMAQ PM2.5 and UFS meteorological forecasts over seven years of simulations for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-defined ten regions using the Air Quality System (AQS) ambient air pollution data from over a thousand monitoring sites across the CONUS. We have found that on average, the CMAQ model performs better in the eastern CONUS with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (10-30 g/m3) while in the west, where wildfires are prevalent, the model has the highest RMSE of up to 120 g/m3. To address these substantial model errors, we advance the field by applying Analog Ensemble (AnEn), a state-of-the-art statistical-dynamical method, to enhance PM2.5 forecast accuracy, with a particular focus on wildfire events, when producing an accurate forecast is highly challenging. We further refine this approach by incorporating a Carbon Monoxide-FIRE (CO-FIRE) tracer to precisely monitor fire smoke. In parallel to our objective and for the first time, we introduce two novel predictors, i.e., a COFIRE tracer in the model, and the maximum observed PM2.5 concentrations from the previous day (PM2.5predaymax), and evaluate their potential significance in improving forecast accuracy, which aligns with the primary goal of our study. Despite the challenges of using AnEn for wildfires, we demonstrate that it has the potential to improve the CMAQ model forecast over the CONUS. We find that AnEn decreases the model RMSE by up to 25%, including additional 7% and 15% reduction by COFIRE and PM2.5predaymax predictors, respectively, at different forecast lead times. In addition, the correlation between AnEn forecasts and observations is 20%-40% higher than that between CMAQ and observations. The Mean Bias Error (MBE) for AnEn forecasts is consistent and approximately 0.5 g/m3 whereas CMAQ MBE varies between 1 and +1 g/m3 between 0-48 forecast hours. AnEn significantly improves the PM2.5 forecast results during its highest episodes. During the initial days of wildfires, AnEn performs similarly to CMAQ.

In this study, we have developed a suite of potential forecast improvements, including dynamic boundary conditions, rapid emission refresh and chemical data assimilation, in a 3km resolution Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. The purpose is to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of these forecasting techniques, individually or in combination, in improving forecast guidance for two major air pollutants: surface O3 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Experiments were conducted for a high-O3 episode (28-29 August 2018) during the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) field campaign, which provides abundant observations for evaluating model performance. The results show that these forecast system updates are useful in enhancing the capability of this 3km forecasting model with varying effectiveness for different pollutants. For O3 prediction, the most significant improvement comes from the dynamic boundary conditions derived from the NOAA operational forecast system, National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), which increases the correlation coefficient (R) from 0.81 to 0.93 and reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) from 14.97 to 8.22ppbv, compared to that with the static boundary conditions (BCs).

Ensemble forecasting has been proposed to reduce the large uncertainties in the wildfire air pollution forecast. This study presents the development of a multi-model ensemble (MME) wildfire air pollution forecast over North America. The ensemble members include regional models (GMU-CMAQ, NACC-CMAQ, and HYSPLIT), global models (GEFS-Aerosols, GEOS5, and NAAPS), and global ensemble (ICAP-MME). Performance of the ensemble forecast was evaluated with MAIAC and VIIRS-SNPP retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AirNow surface PM2.5 measurements during the 2020 Western United States ""Gigafire"" events (August-September 2020). Compared to individual models, the ensemble mean significantly reduced the biases and produced more consistent and reliable forecasts during extreme fire events. For AOD forecasts, the ensemble mean was able to improve model performance, such as increasing the correlation to 0.62 from 0.33 to 0.57 by individual models compared to VIIRS AOD. The ensemble mean also yields the best overall RANK (a composite indicator of four statistical metrics) when compared to VIIRS and MAIAC AOD. For the surface PM2.5 forecast, the ensemble mean outperformed individual models with the strongest correlation (0.60 vs. 0.43-0.54 by individual models), lowest fractional bias (0.54 vs. 0.55-1.32), highest hit rate (87% vs. 40%-82%), and highest RANK (2.83 vs. 2.40-2.81).

Rothermel's fire spread model, a widely used parameterization, relies on midflame wind speed to calculate the fire rate of spread. In coupled fire atmosphere models such as the Community Fire Behavior Model (CFBM), users are required to specify the midflame height before running a fire spread simulation. This study evaluates the use of logarithmic interpolation wind adjustment factors (WAF) for improving midflame wind speed estimates, which are critical for the Rothermel model.

In bulk-plume cumulus convection parameterizations, this type of organization has to be represented in terms of how the resolved flow would ""feel"" convection if more coherent structures were present on the subgrid. This type of subgrid organization acts as building blocks for larger scale tropical convective organization known to modulate local and remote weather. In this work a parameterization for subgrid (and cross-grid) organization in a bulk-plume convection scheme is proposed using the stochastic, self-organizing, properties of cellular automata (CA). We investigate the effects of using a CA which can interact with three different components of the bulk-plume scheme that modulate convective activity: entrainment, triggering, and closure. The impacts of the revised schemes are studied in terms of the model's ability to organize convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). The differing impacts of adopting the stochastic CA scheme, as compared to the widely used Stochastically Perturbed Physics Tendency (SPPT) scheme, are also assessed. Results show that with the CA scheme, precipitation is more spatially and temporally organized, and there is a systematic shift in equatorial wave phase speed not seen with SPPT. Previous studies have noted a linear relationship between Gross Moist Stability (GMS) and Kelvin wave phase speed. Analysis of GMS in this study shows an increase in Kelvin wave phase speed and an increase in GMS with the CA scheme, which is tied to a shift from large-scale precipitation to convective precipitation.","Bengtsson et al.

We show results using a cloud microphysics scheme integrated within the dynamical core of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory System for High-resolution prediction on Earth-to-Local Domains weather model to demonstrate the promise of this concept. We call it the in-line microphysics as it is in-lined within the dynamical core. Statistics gathered from 1 year of weather forecasts show significantly better prediction skills when the model is upgraded to use the in-line microphysics. However, we do find that some biases are degraded with the in-line microphysics.

Dynamical models often struggle to simulate tropical systems that evolve over multiple weeks such as the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO), and these errors can impact geopotential heights, precipitation, and other variables in the continental United States through teleconnections. While many data-driven S2S studies attempt to predict future midlatitude variables using current conditions, here we instead focus on post-processing of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) to predict GEFS errors. Specifically, by looking at when/where there are errors in the GEFS, neural networks can be used to understand what atmospheric conditions helped produce these errors via explainability methods. Our 'Errors of Opportunity' approach identifies phase 4 of the MJO and phases 1 and 2 of the BSISO as significant factors in aiding GEFS error prediction across different regions and seasons. Specifically, we see high accuracy for overestimates of 500 hPa geopotential height (h500) anomalies in the Pacific Northwest during Spring and as well as high accuracy for underestimates of geopotential heights in Northwest Mexico during Summer.

This basic fact implies a poleward energy transport (PET) in both hemispheres, which is accomplished by the atmosphere and oceans. The magnitude of PET is determined by the top of atmosphere gradient in the net radiation flux, and small changes to this quantity must change the total PET in the absence of changes in heat uptake. We analyze a large ensemble of 50 historic climate simulations from the CESM LENS2 project and find a significant PET anomaly in the latter half of the twentieth century. The temporal evolution of this anomaly-with a rapid increase after 1950, a peak near 1975, and a rapid decrease in the 1990s-mirrors the historic trend of sulfur dioxide (SO2, a significant aerosol predecessor) emissions from Europe and North America. This anomaly also appears in an analysis of the PET calculated from ERA5 reanalyses and from the CESM2 Single Forcing Large Ensemble. Consistent with previous studies, we find that historic SO2 emissions from Europe and North America brightened clouds, which reflected additional solar radiation back to space in the midlatitudes: this shortwave anomaly increased the meridional gradient in the net TOA radiation flux and induced an anomalous northward energy transport. Finally, our results suggest that cryosphere processes become an additional important factor in setting the PET anomaly during the first years of the twenty-first century by contributing to the difference in absorbed solar radiation between hemispheres alongside cloud radiative effects. significance statement In this study, we analyze a large group of climate model simulations from 1850 to 2014 and find that this historical pollution changed the way that heat was transported from the tropics to Earth's poles.

The MJO teleconnection is sensitive to a number of factors, including the mean dry static stability, the mean flow, and the propagation and intensity characteristics of the MJO, which are traditionally difficult to separate across models. Each of these factors may evolve in response to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which will impact MJO teleconnections and potentially impact predictability on extended timescales. Current state-of-the-art climate models do not agree on how MJO teleconnections over central and eastern North America will change in a future climate. Here, we use results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical and SSP585 experiments in concert with a linear baroclinic model (LBM) to separate and investigate alternate mechanisms explaining why and how boreal winter (January) MJO teleconnections over the North Pacific and North America may change in a future climate and to identify key sources of inter-model uncertainty. LBM simulations suggest that a weakening teleconnection due to increases in tropical dry static stability alone is robust across CMIP6 models and that uncertainty in mean state winds is a key driver of uncertainty in future MJO teleconnections. Uncertainty in future changes to the MJO's intensity, eastward propagation speed, zonal wavenumber, and eastward propagation extent are other important sources of uncertainty in future MJO teleconnections. We find no systematic relationship between future changes in the Rossby wave source and the MJO teleconnection or between changes to the zonal wind or stationary Rossby wave number and the MJO teleconnection over the North Pacific and North America. LBM simulations suggest a reduction of the boreal winter MJO teleconnection over the North Pacific and an uncertain change over North America, with large spread over both regions that lends to weak confidence in the overall outlook.

Reforecast skill of week-3-4 precipitation and temperature is assessed in terms of the cross-validated ranked probability skill score (RPSS) and reliability diagram. The multimodel reforecasts are shown to be well calibrated for both variables. Precipitation is moderately skillful over many tropical land regions, including Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, and over subtropical South America, Africa, and Australia. Near-surface temperature skill is considerably higher than for precipitation and extends into the extratropics as well. The multimodel RPSS skill of both precipitation and temperature is shown to exceed that of any of the constituent models over Indonesia, South Asia, South America, and East Africa in all seasons.

Understanding connectivity processes between them and with surrounding shelf and deep areas is fundamental for their management. This study focuses on the physical processes related to the connectivity of these reefs. Unprecedented in situ time series were used at these specific reef locations, together with satellite observations and numerical simulations, to investigate the dynamics controlling local circulation on the Southwestern Florida Shelf (SWFS) under oceanic influence. The approach of the Loop Current and Florida Current (LC/FC) system to the SWFS slope can induce 0.5 to 1m/s offshore flows impacting the Pulley Ridge and Dry Tortugas reefs. On the other hand, when the LC/FC system retreats from the slope, onshore flows can carry open-sea waters over the coral reefs. Local formation of cyclonic eddies is possible near the Dry Tortugas reefs in the LC approach case and passage of upstream LC Frontal Eddies is possible in the LC retreat case. Offshore currents 1m/s over the SWFS slope were also found during periods of anticyclonic LC Eddy separation. A novel finding is the shedding and northward propagation of mesoscale anticyclonic eddies from the core of the LC along the West Florida Shelf. Eddy shedding may have a broader effect on the dynamics of the shelf around the study reef areas. Long periods of LC/FC domination over these coral reefs (reaching several weeks to months) are characterized by strong (1m/s) along-shelf currents and continuous upwelling processes, which may weaken the slope stratification and bring colder, deeper waters over the shelf-break and toward the shallower shelf region.","Kourafalou et al.

Less obvious and less well established is that such perturbations can also reduce the errors of the ensemble-mean forecasts and improve the model's mean climate, variability, and sensitivity to forcing. A clear reduction in ensemble-mean forecast errors is demonstrated here in large ensembles of 15-day forecasts made with NOAA's Global Forecast System model. The nearly ubiquitous reduction around the globe, obtained throughout the forecast range, is interpreted as arising in effect from a modification of the model's deterministic evolution operator by a stochastic noise-induced drift. The effect is general in systems with state-dependent noise, and occurs even if the noise is not white. In the atmospheric context considered here, the effect is suggested to arise largely from noise-induced reductions of mechanical and thermal damping by chaotic boundary-layer and cloud-radiative processes, which also tend to increase model sensitivity to forcing. The results presented here are consistent with many previous studies performed with models ranging from simple stochastically forced models to comprehensive global weather and climate models. They suggest that the diabatic interactions in most current global atmospheric models may not be sufficiently chaotic and this deficiency could be partly remedied by specifying additional stochastic terms. Using some empirical guidance in such specifications may be unavoidable, given the generally intractable complexity of the diabatic interactions.","Sardeshmukh et al.
