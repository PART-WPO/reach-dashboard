# REACH Tool  
**Research Explorer for Articles, Code, and Hosted Data (REACH)**      [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/996198515.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16922908)

The [REACH Tool](https://wpo.noaa.gov/reach/) is a web-based open science platform developed by NOAA‚Äôs Weather Program Office (WPO) to provide public access to research outputs generated from WPO-funded projects.  

REACH turns static project lists into a **searchable, filterable, and user-friendly interface**, enabling users to:  
- üîç Search research outputs by keyword or award number  
- üóÇ Filter by program, funded year, output type, and other metadata  
- üìë View outputs in structured card format with direct links to source materials  
- ü§ù Highlight collaborations through Partnership Cards  

## üìä Data Sources  

**Primary Data Source**  
- Metadata originates from [Division-level Open Science Smartsheet Trackers](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/Template%20of%20WPO%20Open%20Science%20Tracker.xlsx) (maintained by each WPO division).  
- Trackers are updated when new outputs are identified, including journal articles detected monthly via the CrossRef API ([see Google Apps Script](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/CrossRef%20API%20Script%20for%20Last%20Month's%20Publications.json)).  
- A **consolidated WPO Smartsheet Report** merges outputs from all divisions into a single dataset (award numbers, titles, authors, output types, resource links).  
- A [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/REACH%20Data%20Pipeline.json) retrieves this dataset via the Smartsheet API, cleans/normalizes it, and uploads it as a CSV to this GitHub repository.  

**Partnership Data**  
- Embedded in the CSV with metadata (partnership name, organization, logo URL, and detail links).  
- Partnership Cards in the REACH UI provide visual attribution and navigation to related resources.

## üîÑ End-to-End Data Workflow  

### Step 0: Collect Publication Data (if starting from scratch)
If you have not yet collected any publication data for your grant awards, you can begin by using two Google Apps Scripts located in the [publication-scripts-starting-point folder](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/tree/main/data-pipeline/publication-scripts-starting-point):
- [Finding All Publications Script using CrossRef API](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/33a841c3adea8f87c2e34a5a7860102e3b8fae77/data-pipeline/publication-scripts-starting-point/Starting%20from%20Scratch_%20Finding%20All%20Publications.json) ‚Äì to search for and collect all publications associated with your award numbers.
- [Finding Abstract Information Script using Semantic Scholar API](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/33a841c3adea8f87c2e34a5a7860102e3b8fae77/data-pipeline/publication-scripts-starting-point/Finding%20Abstract%20Information%20for%20Publications.json) ‚Äì to enrich those publications with abstract data.

These scripts provide a starting dataset that you can then use with the REACH workflow.

### Step 1 ‚Äì Automated Publication Detection (CrossRef API)  
- Monthly automation checks the **CrossRef API** for new publications containing WPO award numbers.  
- The PART Program receives automated email alerts when new matches are found.  
- See [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/CrossRef%20API%20Script%20for%20Last%20Month's%20Publications.json) for more details.  

### Step 2 ‚Äì Smartsheet Data Entry  
- Newly detected publications are entered into [Division-level Open Science Smartsheet Trackers](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/Template%20of%20WPO%20Open%20Science%20Tracker.xlsx) (one per division).  
- Trackers capture metadata such as:  
  - Title  
  - Authors  
  - DOI  
  - Output type  
  - Award number(s)  
  - Program  
  - Links  

### Step 3 ‚Äì Division Data Consolidation  
- Data from all three divisions is merged into a **single super sheet** using a Smartsheet Report.  
- This consolidated report serves as the source for REACH data exports.  

### Step 4 ‚Äì Automated Data Retrieval (Google Apps Script + Smartsheet API)  
- A [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/REACH%20Data%20Pipeline.json) calls the Smartsheet API to pull the consolidated report data.  

### Step 5 ‚Äì Data Cleaning & HTML Preparation  
The Google Apps Script processes the data by:  
- Standardizing dates into consistent `MM/DD/YY` or `MM/DD/YYYY` formats  
- Combining title and abstract text into a single search-optimized field  
- Truncating abstracts for brief UI display  
- Consolidating multiple link fields into one column  
- Formatting output types with HTML icons, labels, and color codes  
- Adding open access labels and icons based on availability  
- Normalizing program and ‚ÄúFunded By‚Äù names  
- Sanitizing text to replace problematic characters and remove non-ASCII  
- Escaping special characters for HTML safety before CSV upload  

### Step 6 ‚Äì Automated CSV Upload (Google Apps Script + GitHub API)  
- The cleaned dataset is saved as a **CSV file**.  
- The script calls the **GitHub API** to commit and push the CSV to PART‚Äôs REACH GitHub repository.  

### Step 7 ‚Äì Public Rendering in REACH (GitHub Pages)  
- The REACH interface is served via a static HTML index file on **GitHub Pages**.  
- **CSS** defines the responsive grid layout, card formatting, colors, fonts, and accessibility.  
- On page load:  
  - The CSV is fetched from **GitHub‚Äôs Raw Content API**  
  - **PapaParse.js** parses CSV ‚Üí JavaScript objects  
  - **Choices.js** enables multi-select dropdown filtering  
  - Results are displayed as responsive cards  
  - Partnership Cards replace standard program info for partnership outputs  

### Step 8 ‚Äì Public Embedding on the WPO Website  
- The live REACH GitHub Page is embedded via an iframe on the WPO‚Äôs public-facing WordPress site.  
- Visitors can access the tool directly without leaving the WPO site.  

## üîÅ Update & Refresh Process  

- The [Google Apps Script](https://github.com/PART-WPO/reach-dashboard/blob/37d73bb771bdec771b2fa5e1b11cbfc5a20bc4ba/data-pipeline/REACH%20Data%20Pipeline.json) is configured with a **time-based trigger** to run automatically on the **15th of every month**.  
- When triggered, the script:  
  1. Calls the Smartsheet API to pull the latest consolidated data  
  2. Cleans, formats, and enriches the dataset  
  3. Uploads the updated CSV to the WPO GitHub repository via the GitHub API  
- The REACH Tool fetches the updated CSV automatically on the next page load, ensuring users always see the most current research outputs.

## üöÄ Hosting & Deployment  

- Static Hosting: GitHub Pages  
- **Fully Automated Pipeline:**  
  1. CrossRef detects new publications ‚Üí Email sent to PART  
  2. PART enters data into Division Smartsheet Trackers  
  3. Consolidated Smartsheet Report merges all division outputs  
  4. Google Apps Script fetches consolidated report via Smartsheet API  
  5. Script cleans/normalizes data and saves as CSV  
  6. Script uploads CSV to GitHub via GitHub API  
  7. REACH fetches CSV on page load for public display  
  8. REACH GitHub Page is embedded via an iframe on WPO‚Äôs WordPress site  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations  

- Pipeline depends on inclusion of and accurate award number entry in publications for detection  
- Initial data entry into Smartsheet Trackers is still manual  
- API rate limits (GitHub, Smartsheet) may impact large updates  

## üîÆ Future Enhancements  

- Direct CrossRef API ‚Üí Smartsheet Tracker integration to eliminate manual entry  
- Automatic DOI metadata enrichment (abstracts, citation formats)
